Second, the thing that impressed me the most was that it actually smelled just like a fresh tangerine! EXACTLY like a fresh tangerine! I have never had a strain that smelled so much like the name! The smoke tasted great! I recognized more of a tangerine essence in the smell rather than the taste, but it still tasted great, nonetheless. As the description says on this bio, it does start off as a social smoke where you can stay focused and carry on a conversation. I'm not feeling so much energetic (as I've had a long day), but I can definitely see it as such. However, too much can leave you with couch lock. That's probably the second v reason why I make this strain my favorite. You can almost control your high with this one. I'd say it's comparable to Camel crush cigarettes in that you can switch from one type of effect to another...but I highly prefer Tangerine Dream over a cigarette any day! All in all, I strongly recommend this strain. Pleasing to the eyes, nose, and taste buds while still delivering a versatile smoke. If you find Tangerine Dream, I strongly suggest you try it.

White Widow is one of the best strains of Cannabis ever produced and its high CBD content, together with other Cannabinoids, have helped it gain its worthy fame for being very appropriate for medicinal uses.Its partner is an AK47 which has also been specially selected for its excellent aromatic and therapeutic properties, as well as for its strength and heavy yield. This selection stands out due to its heavy harvest, outstretched leaves, light green colour, and it’s sweet, fruity, sativa taste, added to a powerful effect thanks to a high proportion of THC compared to its CBD content.Apart from its vigorous growth, this AK 47 has also transmitted to its White Siberian descendants a characteristically sweet aroma and intense effect, somewhat physical and quite cerebral, which is greatly appreciated by medicinal users thanks to its long-lasting effect.","strain":"white-siberian","user":"dbcookin","stars":"4","date":"12/17/2014 2:41 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"265335"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I think the strain is fantastic as a cultivator.has very high on THC levels my outdoor tested at 22%.

Very unique smell n taste for bud, but good, like sweet honeyed fruit with some stank on it.  It was also very smooth smoke n the taste rly comes thru n stays on exhale.  One, rly unique item to mention is the effects, they come on basically instantly, right after u blow out first rip.  In addition it's a very \"feel good\" high that the indica and sativa (50/50 hybrid) aspects r vry well balanced.  For me it's important to have at least a half indica influence, well Nebula cuts thru in a clean way n even picks u up a bit.

The sample i received was in the form of one large nug that had an artful trim, showcasing all the “inner-workings” of the nug but still leaving a perfect amount of leaf matter behind to look natural. The coloration was very light overall, with crispy greens and almost golden-colored pistils in places. this sample, it was a simply beautiful and well cared-for example of an Indica structured strain.\n\nFlavor \nLightly sweet and citrusy on the inhale, more piney and musky on the exhale, this strain definitely tasted much like it smelled, though less pungent overall. The smoke and flavor had a smooth quality that is described as “buttery”, but it also had elements of expansion that could cause some coughing on larger hits. The smooth experience with solid flavor preservation (4-5 hits) finished out with a very light gray and white ash, showing a very good flush\n\nHi Feeling! \npersonal opinion ONLY) Mood elevation, ocular effects, muscle relaxation, moderate pain relief, heavily sedative,\n\nOverall \nThis was a great example of old-school genetics being invigorated with modern growing techniques. The stout Indica-dominant bud structure with fat-headed trichomes and array of light colors was wonderful to admire through the camera lens, while the smell and flavor both exceeded expectations. The “creeper” effect and long duration screamed “Indica \nand this shout out for Northern Lights go to Jp wellness Ashley she always does a great \njob and the rest of jp wellness.","strain":"bf6e7c58-029f-42fb-bf9d-1524e2f2f0ab","user":"santiago911","stars":"4.5","date":"12/22/2014 8:02 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Creative","Focused","Relaxed","Sleepy","Citrus"],"ID":"268267"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-dream","user":"bitshifter","stars":"0","date":"12/22/2014 8:09 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"268268"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-dream","user":"bitshifter","stars":"3","date":"12/22/2014 9:31 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"268269"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-dream","user":"bitshifter","stars":"0","date":"12/22/2014 9:33 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"268270"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-dream","user":"bitshifter","stars":"0","date":"12/22/2014 7:58 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"268298"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-dream","user":"bitshifter","stars":"0","date":"12/22/2014 8:00 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"268299"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-dream","user":"bitshifter","stars":"4","date":"12/22/2014 8:07 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"268300"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Super sleepy great night sleep","strain":"og-18","user":"Bdanie","stars":"4","date":"12/22/2014 8:55 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"268301"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Amazing strain, really earthy and pungent smell that will dank up a room when seal in a smelly proof","strain":"og-shark","user":"dMarijuana98","stars":"5","date":"12/22/2014 10:06 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Earthy","Pungent"],"ID":"268302"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-dream","user":"bitshifter","stars":"0","date":"12/22/2014 8:05 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"268330"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-dream","user":"bitshifter","stars":"4","date":"12/22/2014 8:07 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"268362"},{"_type":"dict","content":"boom","strain":"pineapple-express","user":"999staygold999","stars":"5","date":"12/22/2014 10:08 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Focused","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Talkative","Tingly","Uplifted","Sweet","Berry","Orange","Lemon","Pineapple"],"ID":"268363"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-dream","user":"bitshifter","stars":"0","date":"12/22/2014 10:08 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"268364"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This bud is really nice in my opinion.

I eat it, it is a dark thick tar-like substance in a syringe. I take about 1/4 - 1/2 size of a grain of rice. It takes about an hour to take effect. When it does, I am couch locked, giggly, definitely feel high, and I care a lot less about my pain. Sometimes it makes me feel more tense, or maybe sort of highlights the tension in my neck and shoulders, where I tend to carry my stress. \n\nHowever, if I take more than my usual dose, which I did the other day - it wasn't doing it for me, the pain was still intense, so I took another dose - I ought to have only taken a tiny bit more - but I did another 1/4 - 1/2 grain of rice size bit - it was NOT good. I became overly emotional, my anxiety shot through the roof, I was weepy and paranoid and my thoughts spiraled into super negativity land. DARK thoughts. The only way I made it go away was to sleep it off - which only took a couple of hours but man alive, I have to be really careful with this strain, as I seem to be very sensitive to high CBD strains in that way. \n\nI so very much wanted to find a strain with less of the high and more of the pain relief, but this one wasn't it. I still use it occasionally when there isn't anything else available, but this one it too unpredictable for me. If I have something else available, chances are I will use that instead.

It was recommended to me to help me sleep and to calm my brain at night (to help me sleep). But I've actually found I prefer it as a daytime strain.  Although it isn't the most active of feelings, I am able to get tasks accomplished while using it, like chores, banking online, and my crafts. I wouldn't say I feel clear- headed, but I feel lucid enough to communicate effectively and not come off as \"stoned\" though I can't say I don't feel high.  It does relax me, make my pain much less significant - like I just pay less attention to it but also I seem to get some relief - a little anyway. \n\nBut after using it awhile, in liquid pen vape form, I noticed I began to get headaches whenever I would use it. And I think that is the delivery system and not the strain itself. It started after I used it for a full day rather than just once, and it happened every time I'd use it. So I went down to once a day again, and it continued, even continuing to give me a headache the day after I had used it. I know it was this because I am damn familiar with my own body and all the different kinds of pain I experience, and this was a new one. I don't even know how to explain it. So I stopped, went to my edibles, no headache. I am positive it is the glycerin medium used in making the liquid and not the strain itself. I'm going to test my theory by getting a gram of BCS flower to dry vape or smoke.

I eat it, it is a dark thick tar-like substance in a syringe. I take about 1/4 - 1/2 size of a grain of rice. It takes about an hour to take effect. When it does, I am couch locked, giggly, definitely feel high, and I care a lot less about my pain. Sometimes it makes me feel more tense, or maybe sort of highlights the tension in my neck and shoulders, where I tend to carry my stress. \n\nHowever, if I take more than my usual dose, which I did the other day - it wasn't doing it for me, the pain was still intense, so I took another dose - I ought to have only taken a tiny bit more - but I did another 1/4 - 1/2 grain of rice size bit - it was NOT good. I became overly emotional, my anxiety shot through the roof, I was weepy and paranoid and my thoughts spiraled into super negativity land. DARK thoughts. The only way I made it go away was to sleep it off - which only took a couple of hours but man alive, I have to be really careful with this strain, as I seem to be very sensitive to high CBD strains in that way. \n\nI so very much wanted to find a strain with less of the high and more of the pain relief, but this one wasn't it. I still use it occasionally when there isn't anything else available, but this one it too unpredictable for me. If I have something else available, chances are I will use that instead.

People I have done so much for and they just used me.\n\nSo, I want to compare beginning the day with those ugly, angry thoughts.  Thoughts which emanated from my head, with no stimuli.  Just sitting in bed.   I want to see if the Purple Dream will pull me out of this hole.  If it will let me go take  a walk on this beautiful day, instead of sitting at home nearly in tears.

It enhances appetite and makes me less nauseous while making me feel better mentally. This strain would be good for the daytime as long as your duties arent too physical, but is really ideal for afternoon and evening and it is not a straight knockout so I recommend finding something else for troubles sleeping, this will help, but sleep is not this strains specialty. With the Guava my mind is fully active but my thoughts are more organized and reasonable than usual, making it easier to focus and get stuff done. I highly recommend both the \"Stardawg Guava\" and Natural Mystic in Co springs. They have a great selection of CBD flowers and extracts as well as some of the most consistently high quality hazes and kushes in the state.

I'm dabbing some on a sore inside a nostril, so the whole world smells sweet & dank. This is a subtle Gorilla. Maybe it's Gorilla Glue #6 ;-). It's serious medicine, I don't think it's for the get-fucked-up crowd :  because the effect is so specific. I don't really notice the (78%) THC so much. It's rather masked or antagonized by other components. So there's no squirrel cage shutter-flutter, no anxieties, no confusion, and some might say \"no high\". For social anxiety, it would be a good choice. It's balanced, more on the Indica side -- that unquestionably comes through with a good body melt, and I can believe the reports of couch lock w/ large amounts. Thing is, I wouldn't dream of wasting it that way.\n\nIn small amounts it's a blessing for those living with pain. I know pain, and I know remedies. This is the most atypical cannabis I've ever sampled, because it almost feels like puffs of ope, but with a somehow smarter, more benign analgesia than w/ Rx analgesics. Not a simple thing. But it works calm and measured, positive mood, not fake-euphoric, and with significant pain relief, not limited to the lower spine/legs/back. Pretty long lasting. After a while I notice a subtle secondary boost, sensory, and very mild \"psychedelic\" effects come in. Not a sleepy effect, yet good to fall asleep on. I haven't fully figured it out; it's intriguing. \n\nOn the negatives, well, De Quincy would say who cares, but it's clearly not a party strain. I'd add that it's not as clear-headed as e.g. my favorite Diesels. It lasts, but as it decays I get a smidge fuzzy and sleepy, with a touch of headache, eyes a bit redder than I'd have guessed (so it's relaxing blood vessels). \n\nFocus? With the Gorilla, I can focus on tasks, get a little side-tracked, not feeling lightning bright, but keep going. The unusual pain relief allows all sorts of miraculous tricks, like walking around without wincing, and fully enjoying exploring the planet. A good one to keep in a vape pen for as-needed relief.","strain":"gorilla-glue-4","user":"Fernand","stars":"4","date":"12/27/2014 4:49 AM","attributes":["Concentrate ","Focused","Happy","Relaxed"],"ID":"269923"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"hindu-kush","user":"captn","stars":"4","date":"12/25/2014 5:13 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Aroused","Happy","Relaxed","Talkative","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"269931"},{"_type":"dict","content":"good high just what you need for a good xmas smoke \uD83D\uDE06\uD83D\uDE06\uD83D\uDE06\uD83D\uDE06","strain":"girl-scout-cookie","user":"pudz91","stars":"5","date":"12/25/2014 3:13 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Energetic","Euphoric","Happy","Sweet","Pine"],"ID":"269930"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Love the lemony smell.

So I hit up my dealer asking what he's got and he tells me he has Blue Dream. I quickly  text back that I'll take some but I say it in a way that'll make me seem like I haven't lost my cool. So  I get home from work and my grandma sends me to the store to grab some groceries. I say okay then immediately go upstairs to my room to grind up this beauty and stuff it into my acrylic bong. As I sat there demolishing the perfectly packed nugget of Blue Dream I couldn't help but notice the amount of crystals it had. Now along with my acrylic bong I have a matching acrylic grinder that does not have fancy chambers and luxuries of that nature. No, my single bottom-and-top-cap-with-teeth grinder doesn't collect keif. So I think to myself a little nug wouldn't hurt. I refrain from grinding and collect a small nug which I so carefully place on top of the screen in the bowl of the bong and I toke away. One smooth hit and I was able to fill the chamber of this 12\" acrylic bong and take an additional hit from the smoke in the chamber. I grab my keys and I embark on an adventure.\n--------THE STONED MAN---------\nI really hope you guys get my Hobbit reference just then. Anyways, so I walk out to my truck and I feel the tingles happening behind my head, and I thought \"nice cerebral buzz\" and it was. I drive over to my local grocery store and i feel the effects intesify. The focus, the increased view of my peripheral vision, the energy coming from no where making my mind make decisions effectivly and quickly. I parked and walked inside, at this point my eyes are heavy (not from sleep). I pace myself looking at the different isles. I walk looking for a particular item and when i get to the isle it should be at, theres nothing there. I walk around the store twice looking for assistance only to come back to the isle i was at and asking an employee there. I ask a clerk where it would be and he takes me to an isle close by and hands me the item. I say thanks and walk away. Granted, this doesnt sound like much, but it took me about 20 minutes to ask someone for assistance, at one point i stood still staring at a girl because i thought she worked at the store but couldnt figure out, i later found out she did in fact work there. So i get one item and i go get the rest of the stuff. I continue admiring the store and i end up at the check out lane. I get checked out and the effects are now slowly wearing off. I go to by truck and the ride home is amazing. Looking at all the lights on houses was so invigorating.\n------------THE END------------\nFinally back home i walk in hand my grandma the groceries and she asked for her change. I gave her everything in my wallet (close to $150 and I walked away. Her change was only $8. I come back and I grab the money I count it and correct my error. And by now effects are at their faint, but euphoria was still present. \n\n----------THE VERDICT----------- \nA++\nThis strain delivered intense euphoric and body high on a small dose. Being a frequent smoker I like running into strains that have more potency than usual strains. I would definitely recommend this strain. Last thing I'd like to add is that when I was walking to my truck I was carrying 2 jugs of bleach in one hand. I'll usually do this in short distances but I had parked far back. So the walk was a couple of minutes. The strain gave me the focus to look past the pain I started getting from holding the jugs of bleach in both hands, which leads me to conclude that this could be a great sativa for working out.

It's a Diesel with a purple Indica back. I found this in Eureka, I was driving through. The address and GPS took me to a shoe shop with a relatively surly occupant. I waited patiently as he whipped a customer into shape over the phone, laying down the law on shoeology. They sell serious footwear. Having driven in nano-clean from Canada, crossing dangerous regions like Montana and Idaho where they have firing squads for people like us, I was willing to go along with anyone's method. But I was trying to grasp the situation, imagining old Cerberus pulling a curtain aside, revealing rows of mason jars of medicinal buds in the closet, above the boots. He finally got off the phone and cracked his massive head towards me. I tried \"collective\" ... he gave me a chilling visual evaluation and said \"I thought so. The pot shop. In the back\". I asked why he \"thought so\", but he wasn't going there. It was clear he knew the drill. \"Out back\". \n\nI was happy to find the crew out back gentle and scattered. Lots of kids and a mother hen. They even had half-grams. I got several to try, including the dread Green Crack that they apologetically also called green something harmless.

I smoked it with my boyfriend for the first time about 4 months ago, and it was an incredible body and mental high. Once I took a few hits of it, the discomfort I had in my body went away in the most pleasant way (if there's such a thing lol). My focus and level of arousal with this strain superseded anything else I've tried. Now, yesterday I was lucky enough to try this again and man....this was something I'd never forget. I was smoking with my boyfriend and everything seemed to make me happier than I'd ever been. I was feeling pretty \"excited\" to say the least lol and I was so focused on being excited that I ended up having a \"happy ending\" without even doing anything other than thinking about it (I know I know, tmi). So, with that being said, the level of focus was insurmountable to any other weed I've come across lol. The feeling of utter euphoria is intense but not to the point where you begin to get paranoid about how euphoric you feel. It's definitely a strain I'd recommend to anyone who's looking for a happy high or a new smoker who doesn't want to be freaked out by the experience. There's been a few strains that made me uncomfortable or extremely paranoid and I steer clear from those. But this is an all around amazing high in my opinion.

Auditory attention is hugely expanded and uplifted with this strain, and your tunes will be tenfold as pleasing. \nAbsolutely no paranoia in my trip, which is incredibly rare for me involving such an intense strain. \nFor me, Haze is the perfect example of what the experience of 'weed' should be. \nNot tiring or scary, just impressive and interesting. \nDefinitely recommend, but not to the first-timer as it can be overpowering at first. \n10/10","strain":"haze","user":"Kamekina","stars":"5","date":"12/29/2014 8:08 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Relaxed","Talkative","Uplifted","Dry Eyes","Cheese","Woody","Nutty"],"ID":"271156"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Definitely one of my go to Indica's.

I ground up a decent-sized nug and filled the bowl. First hit was surprisingly harsh, so I choked pretty hard and didn't clear the bong or cash the bowl. I pulled and exhaled the stale smoke and re-lit the bowl. Smoother this time, maybe because I was expecting it. I waited about 4-5 minutes and deciding I wasn't feeling anything and packed another bowl. Full again, but I went it it a little more cautiously, inhaling more slowly, and it reduced the harshness and I didn't choke. After that large hit, I began to feel my eyelids relaxing and I knew the ride had begun. I remember why it's called \"Headband\", because of the feeling of something resting on the crown of your head. To me, it feels like a 3-pound donut that is pressing my skull, but not in a bad way, just like I need to keep my head up and balanced to keep it from falling off. Anyway, dry mouth came on pretty quickly, but not as bad as I get it from Girl Scout Cookies or some other Kush varieties. I always drink mango juice when I'm smoking, so I don't mind feeling thirsty. My lower-back pain went away pretty quickly, and all my joint pain melted after that. Not terribly couchlocked, but I definitely feel like staying in this chair for a bit. Definitely no munchies, although my stomach feels calmer than usual, which is nice. Everything is visually stimulating, especially bright colors. My third bowl has been 4 hits over about an hour, and I'm feeling great. Watching TV with my wife should always be this awesome. Finally, my eyes aren't really dry at all, whereas some strains leave me hitting the eyedrops right after exhaling.\n\nI'm rating Headband as a 4 simply because of its heavy, thick, rough smoke. Everything else is great; pain relief, relaxation, de-stress/anxiety relief, and only minor dry mouth and eyes. If you mentally prepare to take long, slow rips, you'll be happy with Headband. \n\nKeep your head up straight or you'll drop the donut thingy!","strain":"headband","user":"KevinH112","stars":"4","date":"12/30/2014 11:22 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy","Relaxed","Talkative","Uplifted","Violet","Earthy","Pungent","Skunk","Tea","Sage","Pepper"],"ID":"271421"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"bubba-kush","user":"emjay23","stars":"4","date":"12/29/2014 6:58 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Talkative","Dry Mouth","Creative","Euphoric"],"ID":"271434"},{"_type":"dict","content":"takes a little time to hit, but smooth ride in. very relaxing.

I didn't notice the pain in my knees so much nuking something.  Still couldn't fix a gourmet meal if my life depended on it unless I get them replaced.  Don't want to think about that.  Meal is ok, just ok, not too bad for a prepared meal though, but then pot seems to make everything taste better.  But I think you have to like the food to begin with.

Both times I did too much and experienced severe paranoia, my heart raced, and I could feel my muscles pulling.  Too much meaning 2-3 hits on the bong.  This strain is low in THC so I kept thinking I wasn't feeling anything so I took another hit.  Bad move.  I've learned the hard way not to judge my medicine dose by \"how I feel\" because I can't do that with low THC/High CBD strains.  Where the paranoia came from I don't know because I don't see it listed as one of the problems with this strain.  Which means it is affecting me differently than the national average.  I did find that if I just took 1 hit only and waited 1 1/2 to 2 hours between hits that I did not experience that paranoia.  Unfortunately I did not experience a lot of pain relief either.  It did help me to fall asleep though but some Sativas do me the same way and this is supposed to be an Indica dominant Hybrid.  I'm beginning to get concerned that my experiences with different strains do not coincide with the norm so I will not be able to use the charts to figure out what strains would be best for me.  It's just going to be trial and error, which could take me longer since I may not be able to use the advice of the internet web sites like Leafly which has compiled a great amount of information for us to use.  So my conclusion is this strain is pretty much useless to me if I only get pain relief when I use too much and get paranoia.  Not fun.","strain":"cannatonic","user":"scottiedogfan","stars":"1","date":"1/4/2015 4:54 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Sleepy","Paranoid"],"ID":"273431"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Why do they call a driveway a driveway and a parkway a parkway?","strain":"super-lemon-haze","user":"MCapers","stars":"5","date":"1/4/2015 6:16 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"273432"},{"_type":"dict","content":"\"Pineapple\" from Monkey Grass Farms is an amazing 60% Indica Dominant Hybrid yielding 26.8% THC. It has a VERY \"Fruity\" potent fragrance. Once inhaled it has a berry/fruit flavor, the closest comparison in food would be opening & biting into a fresh cold sweet juicy Pineapple. Try to appreciate the taste of flowers by doing this simple but effective \"Sampling\" technique; When you exhale through your nose. Towards the end of exhaling, exhale through your mouth and taste the fruitiness in your mouth, you'll notice that this strain even leaves a nice fruity after taste. You'll love it. Cheers!\n\nAt \"Grass - Seattle\" the Rec Store in North Seattle. They have a deal going on which is kind of like a \"2 for the price of 1\"! That's right! 2 grams for $25! That's $12.50 per Gram. That's an unbelievably good deal, it's kind of like BOGO, if you think about it? Oh & It's outdoor grown. So it'll have that nice REAL \"Earth Grown, not Hydro\" taste and high :)\n\nThe impression I'm getting is that \"Pineapple\" is an Indica that acts like a Sativa. There is no cloudy feeling but you do get a great \"Head High\" & it's a great \"Body High\" at the same time without the \"Couch lock\" effects. It definitely relaxes the consumer & keeps them feeling \"Happy\" ;) \n\nMy Pairing suggestion:\nDefinitely, Listen to your favorite upbeat type of music. This Strain is great for gaming, girls/guys night out or in, TV Series binge watching. It definitely helps with social anxieties. It keeps you mellow enough to enjoy the company of others as well as uplifting yourself if your alone. \n\nGet Physical!\nYou'll want to go do something fun or explore nature by walking outside. \n\nWhen's the last time you simply put on you headphones and just either ran or walked outside? Get some fresh air! At night, by breathing natural oxygen it will stimulate the neurochemical creation of Serotonin & Melatonin. Which the bodies needs especially here in the Northwest since we're mostly Vitamin D Deficient, which eventually leads to different forms of Depression and/or Anxieties. There are many benefits that people don't really know about Marijuana. If you're \"New\" or \"Coming Back\". I would suggest coming here to Leafly. Go to their knowledge center & read all the great information about the \"Wonderful World of Marijuana\". :)\n\nFood:\nEat something tasty & greasy ;) Like a Double Bacon Cheeseburger with hot salty fries. Washing it down with either a Large, Ice cold, soda, beer or whatever beverage you choose.","strain":"5e6ef78a-903c-4159-9263-91f1a6e3f243","user":"manny97233","stars":"5","date":"1/4/2015 6:38 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Creative","Aroused","Energetic","Euphoric","Focused","Talkative","Uplifted","Tingly","Giggly","Hungry","Relaxed","Dry Mouth","Dry Eyes","Sweet","Berry","Tropical","Tree Fruit","Pineapple","Earthy","Pungent"],"ID":"273433"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I felt like I could feel my heart slowing down.

I attained a mild buzz from just one hit off of my friends bong, as well as that one hit completely curing my mild headache. After a few more hits I had a very nice and relaxing high. All tension in my body was gone and I was completely stress free, the only thing on my mind at the time was watching Netflix and munching some chips. This strain does not give a huge case of the munchies luckily. After smoking another bong with my friend I developed a minor headache which was most unfortunate. After the two bongs I became very tired but decided to smoke another to really test out the effects. After the third I laid down on my buddy's bean bag chair and passed out. I strongly recommend this strain for anyone looking to get a great nights sleep, trying to relax after a hard days work, need to cure your headache/muscle/body pains(I only had minor ones at the time so for anything serious I can't say). I do not recommend smoking this strain in large amounts or for anyone trying to get a high to more enjoy various activities such as work or hanging out with friends(unless you are all just chillin out maxin relaxin all cool).

Lavender, lemon, and heady pine make a crisp perfume, far and away from any \"skunky\" or \"sour\" notes.\n\nNugs are hyperdense, being more akin to pebbles. Fairly crumbly once broken up, a smooth smoke that has an almost indulgent taste. A dandelion sugar cookie. \n\nFinishing on a triumphant crescendo, the high is nostalgic of your first time. Deep, ponderous, full bodied, a bit trippy if you over indulge.It embodies so well what being high is, taking a bit of the best traits, from some of the best strains, and merges into a complex buzz that manages to not feel muddled, or heavy.\n\nFor the experienced only, this strain will get even the jaded enthusiasts back into the spirit. While a surprisingly comfortable high,  it's probably best for low energy affairs. Nice dinners, or movie night. \n\nBest served with comfort food, your favorite album, and a warm hug.","strain":"jack-frost","user":"UrsaMajor","stars":"5","date":"1/6/2015 9:43 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Uplifted","Sweet","Lemon","Flowery","Lavender","Violet"],"ID":"274385"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"golden-goat","user":"CoinedHatchBack","stars":"4","date":"1/6/2015 10:37 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Energetic","Giggly","Talkative"],"ID":"274386"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Not bad at all, I had some with my buddy last night and I was feeling relaxed as fuck, of course my eyes were redder than the Devils dick","strain":"afghan-haze","user":"toejam169","stars":"4","date":"1/6/2015 2:28 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Uplifted","Sleepy","Hungry"],"ID":"274387"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"3b42c8fb-9ccd-46e0-9c13-4931e9836b5f","user":"thegbudfarmacy","stars":"5","date":"1/6/2015 5:09 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Focused","Relaxed","Sleepy","Uplifted","Paranoid"],"ID":"274388"},{"_type":"dict","content":"very good strain! was constantly in a daze just chillin. taste is a good earthy taste with a pretty lastly after taste. i also   have ADHD and this actually put me at ease and i was able to focus during conversations but if i was solo im off in another world haha.","strain":"super-skunk","user":"TokedWolf","stars":"5","date":"1/6/2015 7:07 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Relaxed","Earthy","Skunk"],"ID":"274389"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Amazing strain","strain":"super-lemon-haze","user":"rtiqulit","stars":"5","date":"1/6/2015 7:25 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Focused","Citrus","Lemon"],"ID":"274390"},{"_type":"dict","content":"makes you happy","strain":"caramelo","user":"lilypadfoot","stars":"4","date":"1/6/2015 7:46 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"274391"},{"_type":"dict","content":"dope as hell, makes me think a lot and feels great","strain":"green-crack","user":"pseudipto","stars":"4","date":"1/6/2015 10:53 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Euphoric","Focused","Uplifted","Happy","Hungry"],"ID":"274392"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I selected this strain from Private Label Organics in Southern Orange County.

It's a layered flavor roller coaster that is highly temperature dependent. When you hit the sweet spot, around 650 F on an enail it's most amazing. The flavor upon inhale first is strikingly pungent and rather chemy as soon as you realize the pungent flavor it instantly changes and explodes into a spicy cherry mint, upon first exhale it reminds me of a fresh cherry lifesaver. Clear the lungs with fresh air and savor the cherry lifesaver blast as it last for a lip smacking 3-5 breaths after the exhale. Truly a super terpene rich flavor bomb for your palette.  I must admit the flavor can be so strong it's overwhelming to the senses and for a quick second during the explosion it tastes shockingly pungent and kind of briefly unpleasant. I think it may be too much for the senses  to process it's so strong. The dewaxed harle tsu I tried as smooth as a cool glass of water with a clear headed instant pain relief effect. You can rip a dab session with the most potent oil you have, then take a dab of harle tsu and snap out of a foggy high into a clear headed intensely focused vibrational clarity. It's not a buzz it's a cloud buster. Got to go to work or deal with people this is great medicine that provides pain relief and gives you a crystal clarity you need to do your day to day.

I would highly recommend this strain to kush lovers out there that want that uplifting sativa high, although i may have just stumbled across a unicorn phenotype.. ; )\n\nPeace!","strain":"rug-burn-og","user":"tafarai","stars":"4.5","date":"1/9/2015 7:49 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Focused","Uplifted","Grapefruit","Lemon","Lime","Pungent","Skunk","Pine","Diesel"],"ID":"276342"},{"_type":"dict","content":"bazinga! \uD83D\uDCA8\uD83D\uDCA8\uD83D\uDCA8","strain":"green-crack","user":"28gramms","stars":"0","date":"1/9/2015 9:07 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"276343"},{"_type":"dict","content":"helped my back pain right away.

Heres the unique thing we found about it: we could sort of pause our high and have a serious discussion, then return to being high. Sound weird? I dont know how else to explain it. Sort of like a buzz toggle we could turn on and off. In other words, we were stoned, but we could still think very lucidly and have a totally normal conversation, or a goofy one . That's the best I can explain it. Long story short : this is a great strain. Love it. But skip it if you want to get deep because it's not a cerebral, introspective, dramatic high. It's very chill.

The first part of the high was pretty spectacular all around, actually. But after my initial reaction, I started to feel a lot more mellow and sleepy, a feeling which is still lingering, four hours later.

The buds where on the smaller side and they had perfect structure. They were frosted white with hints of green beneath. This strain has earth and sweetness in its medium pungent aroma.

I found a seed in the 3.5 grams I purchased during Happy Hour for $40. After doing some research and learning from a large quantity grower that the sleepy indica effects will increase if the flower is grown too long, I decided to plant the seed. I think I've cloned her a dozen times. She grows wide with big leaves, and has a heafty yield. She is usually done flowering in 60 days, minus the heavy sweating effects.

Almost looks white fuzzy moldy it's so covered in crystals (it's not actually moldy  ;) ).  Tightly packed, round/oval buds.  When ground up, it looks like it's about twice as much as you'd think it's so dense.\n\nFlavor:  I'd describe as Pungent.  It's pleasant w/o being overwhelming.\n\nSmell/Odor:  And with flavor comes smell/odor.  This strain is VEEEERY strong smelling.  There is no way you're opening the sealed container for this stuff indoors w/o it stinking up the whole place.  If you wanted a good representation of what medical MJ should smell like, this is it.  If you're walking around with it in your pocket, make sure it's in a sealed container of some sort, unless you're looking to attract a lot of attention.\n\nConclusion:  This strain is the perfect example of what a potent, healthy marijuana strain should be.  Dense nuggets that burn forever, and a powerful smell strong enough to make your eyes water, this is the definition of a overall outstanding strain.

I've been smoking regularly for a year now and taking my first puff of this trainwreck was almost comparable to my first puff of marijuana back in high school. this is a very potent strain. over the course of the week until now I was able to stay high for the better part of it. the high came on almost immediately and seemed to peak about an hour after smoking then slowly and gradually faded away over the course of around 3-4 hours. after each consecutive smoke (ie smoking 1 bowl on a bong the first day then smoking another bowl on the second day and so on..) the high gradually lessened in intensity and length. for this reason I highly recommend using this strain sparingly and if you need to, smoke a different strain between smoking sessions with this one.\n\nTL;DR: this strain is very potent and should be smoked sparingly to enhance the effects of the high","strain":"trainwreck","user":"vengeurban","stars":"5","date":"1/21/2015 10:31 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Uplifted","Citrus","Lemon","Woody","Pine"],"ID":"284618"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Berner’s Cherry Pie Dr. Green Thumb Aliso Viejo\nTime consumed: 3:03 PM 1/21/15 First of the day\nAmount:  1 scoop approx.  ¼ gram\nGrinder: Simba four piece\nMethod of Consumption: About two Full Pulls from the Vapor Tower Vaporizer, run through a KONG bong\n\nReview:  Having had a fairly uneventful work day, I was not in a hurry to come home and switch my brain off, and I’ve had this Beautiful 1/8 of Cherry Pie chillin in the chest so I thought this could be a match made in heaven.\n\nIt’s an absolutely gorgeous flower.  Every square millimeter is plastered with the tiniest crystals, we have dark orange hairs, blackish, purple light and sage green colorations and it reeks to high heaven of Sweet Funk.  And yes you can reach for it and find the “Cherry Pie” aroma and taste, especially when using a good air vape.  It’s super dense, but not rock hard and dry.  Just think …dank and what comes to mind is what you will see.\n\nEffects are not straight away.  I was able to get three solid vapor pulls from my test scoop.  The high is functional, but without care or stress.  My afternoon activities will go unhampered for the most part, but the routine tasks will be easier and I dare say more “fun” as a result.  For a hybrid it’s leans Sativa and at least with the amount I consumed I’m unlikely to get stuck on the couch for long.  This strain has just enough “get up n’ go” that I require in the late afternoon.\n\nThis is a LUX weed.  It was grown with great care, cured perfectly and is fine to look at.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, since it's way easier to keep a straight face or play serious if the need arises.  The head feels like it's stuffed with cotton and there's a sense of attempted - but not quite there - mental clarity. It's almost like bringing your toolbox to deal with a big project you're familiar with and not being able to find all the tools needed: the intent and focus are there, but the facilities to make use of these is lacking.  \n\nNot bad for, say, writing internet reviews or reading some straightforward comics.

Even before I smoked it I could tell this was going to be an excellent high. I smoked a small amount, and my high was very much like my experience on Adderall. I was able to focus very well on one particular thing, while simultaneously ignoring any distractions easily. Everything besides what you are focusing on just goes in the background which would allow me to focus. I later smoked this strain again and then played basketball. My hand eye coordination was a little lacking compared to how it is on some other strains. Not for normal activities, but I noticed this when I played basketball while high, and this is not the case with all strains. Sometimes my hand eye coordination is excellent after I smoke. Sometimes after smoking, I feel as if the basketball and my hand are one, allowing me to handle the ball with precision and creativity. However, it wasn’t bad, and I still was able to play well. I could definitely see myself smoking this during the day and getting shit done. After basketball I went home, smoked some more, and went to sleep. My sleep was excellent, which is normally not the case. Not sure if it was the basketball or the weed. I think it was a little of both.\n\nOh yea, it’s also a good social strain.

Space Bomb has an incredibly complex flavor and aroma, like few others. Sweet, and earthy notes of pine, sage, a sweet floral flavor I can't quite describe specifically. The many layered flavor is definitely to be savored. The effect comes on gently, but definite. Living up to its name and parentage, your head is lifted to a floaty, ebbing and flowing peaceful happiness. Even heavy worries fade a bit, as the heavy, tingling body feel takes over. Pain melts, and eases away replaced by a wonderful euphoria to match the peaceful mental state. Sense of touch is amplified making that hot shower feel incredible, and be that much more effective at relaxing the mind and body. A great overall effect, happy, creative mind with substantial physical relief and pleasure. Great at improving appetite. Be calm, and happy, feel good throughout your day, as Space Bomb allows one to still be active, if a bit daydreamy. Recommend it for everyone, couples will love it.

Quite frosty.

If you consume a lot, this can also be great for insomnia at night.  Smaller amounts are uplifting and great for the daytime.  Energetic.  Great just before going hiking, or exploring the outdoors. \n\nDepending on the amount consumed, it can have two different highs.  In very small doses, it's sativa lineage dominates, creating an uplifting, euphoric, energetic high, which is ideal for daytime.  Taking more of the strain can make it become a true day-wrecker!\n\nTasty, but can be a little harsh.\n\nPMP Tester experience:  The taste was pretty incredible!  Like a dark, juicy berry, mixed with sweet cream.  Slightly harsh, but still very pleasant.  Good pain relief.  I was having a back spasm and tried it.  Pain did not disappear, but subsided enough to be able to work.  Very functional at a low dose.  Does NOT cause munchies!  Almost gives you a \"full\" feeling.

Have to be careful about heart palpitations, so I don't do 3.  Just a little bit of dry mouth with this one.

The twitches are something I've had occasionally because of my MS, but this was continual and worse.

Alot of ppl aren't sure what strains were crossed to make this beautiful plant. I have a good friend whose been growing for over 25 yrs, an old OG hippie. I wanted him to prove to me that purple cream really was (purple urkle x GDP x purple urkle), so he grew it and sure enough it had the same look,smell, taste, and the same warm bodied, couchlock but euphoric thoughts, and that was when I was sold on this strain and will pick it up ANYTIME its available. My buddy grew it from scratch cuz he can STRAIGHT UP GROW! He yielded 4 lbs from his greenhouse in his backyard and was curious as to what quality he grew so he sold a lb to a local dispensary and the results came back A WHOPPING 27% THC and he also managed to squeeze a lil under 3% CBD in it too which helped ALOT since it had such high THC for an indica, this can lead to paranoia in many people, CBD tends to take away the paranoia and CBD is also highly medicinal helping ppl with seizures along with countless other ailments. I bought numerous batches of this strain and I def know that this plant grows VERY SIMILAR if not IDENTICAL batches as long as u TRULY know how to grow as I started\n purchasing this strain back in '09 and it's now 2015, I've got it from numerous different dispensaries to this day and the perfect quality remains the same EVERY SINGLE TIME. Covered in crystals, dense dark buds with orange hairs. Smells like urkle more than anything. For being made up of 2 of the strongest and well known purple strains, the taste isn't as great as you'd expect it to be, it mainly tastes like purple urkle but I would assume that's cuz purple urkle was crossed in this strain on the front end and the back end. THIS STRAIN WILL RELAX THE SHIT OUT OF YOU, SO DON'T SMOKE THIS BEFORE DOING ANYTHING FUN OR ACTIVE AS U WILL BE DRAGGING ASS. ALSO DONT DO WHAT I DID, I SMOKED AT ABOUT 11 A.M., THEN WITHOUT EXPECTING IT, MY DISABLED MOTHER ALL OF A SUDDEN NEEDED ME TO RUN A QUICK ERRUND FOR HER RIGHT WHEN I WAS DONE SMOKING MY PIPE. I TRIED TO STALL BUT I THINK THAT ONLY MADE THE PURPLE CREAM HIT ME HARDER,, LONG STORY SHORT, I BRIEFLY fell asleep at the wheel and rear ended a regional transit bus and I went to jail for a DUI. The airbag deployed and broke my nose and flat out just hit me in the face HELLA hard. I was worried about the ppl on the bus so I tried to get out all smooth n shit but I guess I didn't realize how hard the airbag hit me cuz I was falling down and couldn't keep my balance and shit and then the cops get there and this 1 bitch kept asking me \"how many drinks have u drank today and I seriously don't drink so I'm like \" ma'am, I don't drink, then she says \"oh so u always can't stand up when you try to walk?\"\"Then she said the funniest thing ever, she was about 10-15 feet away from me and then she says \" Sure you don't drink, I can smell the alcohol from here\" (this bitch is a cop BTW) I said ma'am the airbag just broke my nose and I'm sure I have a concussion (I knew both of these things to be true since I had started karate at age 5, then take kwon doe, then full on MMA. On top of that I played organized football from age 7 to college football,, so I KNEW a broken nose and a concussion as I'd experienced all of the above numerous times. Then she says \"BULLSHIT I can smell the alcohol from here LOL...let's just say I made her look STUPID AS FUCK at sac county jail when I blew a 0.00!!! Then she got yelled at by the nurses right in front of me for not taking me directly to the hospital for my concussion and broken nose as I just sat there with a grin so fuckin big on my face and I was looking right at her. She probably wanted to just pull her gun out and kill me right there, especially in the car ride when I asked her \"So what do you think it was that u were smelling when you said that you could smell the alcohol on me from at LEAST 10 feet away!!\"","strain":"purple-cream","user":"ckoko1369","stars":"5","date":"1/27/2015 1:01 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Euphoric","Focused","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Tingly","Sweet","Berry","Grape","Tree Fruit","Plum","Flowery","Lavender","Earthy","Pungent","Skunk"],"ID":"289425"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Tried a G2 headband bud and experienced the most intense head and body stone I've ever had.

So I went and bought sum fox farm \"grow big\" 6-4-4. I started using that in late July and damn near immediately the plant started getting very bushy like indicas always do, the stock started growing thick and so did the branches and the height even started taking off. Come harvest time it was November 14th and it was supposed to rain the next day, so I had been flushing the plant for 8 days with just clean,plain water. And to make the buds look magical, since Halloween it had been getting down into the low 50's at night, so every night before bed I would go to the grocery store and buy a bag full of ice and then dump the ice all over the soil and around the plant. This worked perfect as I was able to get it just cold enough every night so it made my buds a beautiful purple color like I had never seen before. I also experimented a lil too and when I would flush the plant out with clean water and molasses to make the buds super sticky. I would also put kool aid (grape flavor) and OMG this increased the berry smell and grape taste. This was sum grade A bud. The high was equally as good if not better than the stuff (including other purple urkle batches at dispensaries). I got my grow to look more purple and it had a better high! But unfortunately due to the fact that I didn't plant it until too late in the growing season and I also didn't get good/high nitrogen plant food so I was lucky to harvest the lil 2 ounces I got on that grow. I want some GDP seeds to grow and plant in early March to get it huge and I'd be curious to see how much bigger of a yield that GDP would get me compared to other purple indicas","strain":"granddaddy-purple","user":"ckoko1369","stars":"4","date":"1/27/2015 7:41 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Euphoric","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Tingly","Berry","Grape","Flowery","Lavender","Earthy","Pungent","Skunk"],"ID":"289904"},{"_type":"dict","content":"The Sativa dominant strain Cabbage Patch was recommended to me by one of OrganiCann's budtenders as a strain that they could, \"smoke all day, with a minimal comedown.\" I found this to be true along with the other patients I shared the strain with. \n\nCabbage Patch looks and smells totally sweet. It has a platinum coating of crystals and is fluffy with a light texture of red hairs. It smells of lavender and honey, and the greens hit tastes of clean sage and violet. \n\nThe high is a smooth elevation into an energetic, happy, creative, and conversational state, while lacking a hard, heady edge. It's percentage of indica is low, but it's just the right amount for balancing it's strong sativa characteristics. It can get buzzy at higher levels of consumption, but the indica keeps the sativa high at bay, adding a warm and grounding feel to an otherwise pure energy high. Overall, the effects of this balance are very good. \n\nThe Cabbage Patch high allows for collaborative efforts between people, and a presence that is often strong and lucid. I found myself listening intently to others without spacing out and communicating clearly with a cutting perspective. I felt motivated to shape the world around me, while paying attention to the world and what it had to say. \n\nWhen the high fades, it's mainly a return to a normal state. It generally fades after a couple hours if you're smoking it. People I've shared the herb with often comment on how much energy they have after the comedown. There's a very slight fog, but it's not distracting or debilitating. Using Cabbage Patch throughout the day works well, as the budtender suggested, and overall it's exactly what I'm looking from a sativa dominant strain.","strain":"0e0d3ba1-a967-4890-89af-4092c54d5fb5","user":"bunger11","stars":"5","date":"1/27/2015 6:44 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Uplifted","Energetic","Creative","Focused","Relaxed","Sweet","Violet","Plum","Lemon","Sage","Lavender","Honey"],"ID":"289930"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Very nice to smoke throughout the day without too much of a haze or drowsiness that you'd get with a full indica OG strain.

When I share this strain around with friends, they all are impressed with the flavor and effects of it.\n\nFlavor is citrusy, but unlike Orange Crush, doesn't have that soda sugar quality to it. It's tart, almost like a lemon or fresh orange flavor. \n\nFeelings I've consistently gotten was an awake mood. Bright, uplifting. It's almost like I naturally feel like I'm sitting on spongy grass, or laying on it. My sensitivity to temperature is nicer, usually feel like I'm in a fresh spring morning where the heat of the sun feels sharp. Almost like under a tree.\n\nI might make a new review or edit this later. I've only bought 1 gram of \nit, been using a Magic Flight Launch-Box and have been improving my technique every day with meditation. Been trying strains all over and have articulated with friends in great length over the feelings and tastes we have.

Like other PTSD folks, I have good days and bad days.  The past two months have been especially difficult as I'm going through a rough period in my life.  I tried Headband for the first time a couple of nights ago.  I am temporarily on a bong until my vaporizer arrives in the mail.  Not all strains work well with PTSD (some can actually make symptoms worse).  Headband IS a strain that works exceedingly well for me.  After 2 or 3 good tokes, the delusional paranoid thinking and severe depression subsided.  Another common symptom of PTSD is digestive problems.  My weight dropped from 105lbs to 94lbs between late November to present due to lack of appetite from spastic colon (horribly painful) and nausea.  Headband immediately alleviated all spasms within five minutes after use, which makes it an excellent pain reliever as well.  I was finally able to eat a decent amount of food yesterday without doubling over in pain, and feel much better today because of it.  I also found Headband helps with fatigue.  I was relaxed and mellow without being couch locked, making it a good choice for daytime use.  Headband wouldn't be my first recommendation for wanting to get super high.  It does make you high, but not blasted.  You will feel buzzed, but won't be seeing pink bunnies shooting paintballs at you anytime soon.  Highly recommend!","strain":"headband","user":"Camlin","stars":"4.5","date":"1/28/2015 3:44 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Happy","Dry Mouth","Lemon"],"ID":"290602"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blackberry","user":"pvtpain66k","stars":"3","date":"1/28/2015 5:35 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Uplifted","Hungry","Happy","Aroused","Focused","Dry Eyes","Berry","Sweet","Grape","Blueberry","Tropical","Pungent","Earthy","Woody","Spicy/Herbal","Sage","Pepper"],"ID":"290603"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"chemdawg-91","user":"StrangeAttraktor","stars":"4","date":"1/28/2015 6:05 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Earthy","Pungent","Skunk","Nutty","Coffee"],"ID":"290604"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This strain gives a very uppity high that leaves you mellow and relaxed but also giggly until it finally starts to put you to sleep.

But to its credit I did get super high real quick and it wore off quick so this strain would be great for an all day smoke fest but would allow you to get shit done if you needed to.","strain":"jack-wreck","user":"TexasBeerMan","stars":"4","date":"1/28/2015 9:16 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Hungry","Relaxed","Uplifted"],"ID":"291018"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"ak-47","user":"zach412","stars":"5","date":"1/29/2015 12:12 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"291019"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I love love love it!!! gave me the best high ever.

No couch lock but strong desire to listen to music, no tv.  Extremely focused and sensitive to feelings and communication. Listened to Native American flutes. Connected with my wife and daughters at a cool level. Next time I would like 1/2 the dosage.","strain":"purple-cream","user":"cellarsurfer","stars":"4","date":"1/30/2015 5:14 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Happy","Uplifted","Relaxed","Euphoric"],"ID":"292813"},{"_type":"dict","content":"this was a great strain!

At first I thought it was going to be garbage because of how it was manicured and trimmed, but after pealing back some of the few layers the buds had some pretty nice crystals.  We had to dry out most of what he had which was a lot but after the pungent smelling drying time the weed crumbled well enough and didn't really even have problems in my horrible grinder.  Oh one thing is that his weed has lots of stems.  Its definitely not on like a platinum level grade by any means but like a few tokes before class is perfect for that situation and then like just now smoking like 5 joints rolled back to back and being high as shit is perfect for what I want it to be.  Also could play in part to the edible I ate made by Love's Oven but i'll be doing a review of this in a few minutes.  not much to expect really not the best edible by itself but ehhhhhh wait ill just tell you in that review.  Oh I would also say that this weed is more than likely a sativa or a hybrid leaning more sativa.  The buds are more small and not very dense which has me thinking sativa. I'm also not the best judge by just looks so who knows.  More than likely its just a random house strain hybrid.","strain":"bee62b97-0d63-4d99-ab4e-43c727095d4d","user":"dubbriot","stars":"3.5","date":"1/31/2015 6:31 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Focused","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Talkative","Tingly","Uplifted","Dry Mouth","Dry Eyes","Chemical","Spicy/Herbal"],"ID":"293966"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"og-kush","user":"khansmeyer","stars":"3","date":"1/31/2015 10:36 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Giggly","Hungry","Sleepy"],"ID":"293967"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"grape-ape","user":"atirado96","stars":"5","date":"1/31/2015 10:39 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Hungry","Dry Mouth","Sleepy"],"ID":"293968"},{"_type":"dict","content":"2/3 of a doob... damn","strain":"gorilla-glue-4","user":"Z56J","stars":"5","date":"1/31/2015 3:26 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Giggly","Uplifted","Relaxed","Tingly"],"ID":"293969"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I became a fish for like 3 seconds...

The body effects were very soothing, relaxing like having two beers, but with a very clear head similar to how you feel after a long run or hard workout. \n\nOver several smoke sessions I mixed this strain with higher thc strains like kosher kush and silver haze and loved the control it gave me over the high. Many high thc strains make my head racy and bring on anxiety for me, but cannatonic let me sample some really high thc buds and dial the effects back when I overdid it.

I moved to Colorado this year and immediately pursued this, my most sought after of nugs. My room mate works for a dispensery and they had Orange Herijuana, of which I was very unimpressed. Beautiful nugs and amazing smell but the sativa cross was counter productive to what I had hoped and anticipated Herijuanas high to be. needless to say I was saddened. Had my expectations been too high? Did I just hype a small paragraph on a strain in a book written almost 15 years ago? My room mates who have lived in Colorado for years hadn't had Herijuana and u felt determined to show them, and more importantly myself, Herijuana was the strongest nug available. At least strongest as far as I've rated a high, being from the NY/NJ area. Finally tracing down and grabbing that first gram of pure Herijuana was as exciting as it was nerve racking! Will it be what I believed it to be all this time or would I be let down again like I was with her sweet and unique orange cousin? I had been dabbing heavily the 2 weeks leading to the aquisition of the Herijuana so that added to the odds stacked against her. also was the multitude of other amazing and beautiful nugs in town like the Pacific Coast Kush I got that smelled and tasted like heaven or my room mates favorite golden goat which still tastes like a dream u once had as a kid. The bong rips of Herijuana(2 rips) were almost instant affirmation of all my years of wondering. This shit is without a doubt the most bad ass pot I ever had! I barely made it to the couch before re discovering hot rod on Netflix and feeling accomplished in life in a way I never had before. I moved to Colorado from the east coast to pursue a career in the industry and to have my extract making room mates applaud the high Herijuana gave them after seeking it exclusively for SO long was a way I've felt proves to me I knew what I was talking about when I read the only bible that ever meant anything to me.

No effect felt all. Another patient trying this with me had identical experiences with it. I can't recommend this to anyone, in fact I would discourage even trying it for the price.","strain":"e619add3-7e47-454b-816d-d07f72d07888","user":"CTpatient","stars":"0.5","date":"2/2/2015 3:47 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize"],"ID":"294995"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Great deal for the strain.

Rumor is that T20 gold is sour diesel, no idea if that is true. This is the number one flower in CT in my opinion. I love it, perfect right to the head high that leaves you energized and clear minded. Unfortunately the flower was available only once in last 5 months so it's a rare  flower for availability, they focus on edibles, tinctures and vape cartridge. Should I see it again I'll stock up LOL","strain":"6d3fa209-92cc-46a3-8898-8a5381385e57","user":"CTpatient","stars":"5","date":"2/2/2015 3:31 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Energetic","Focused","Uplifted","Diesel","Skunk","Pungent","Lemon"],"ID":"294994"},{"_type":"dict","content":"this stuff made my head super cloudy.
