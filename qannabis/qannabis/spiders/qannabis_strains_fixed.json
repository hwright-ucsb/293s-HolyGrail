The color is either brownish gold or a mixture of gold and green. This grade has a potency surpassed by few of the green varieties and usually comes at slightly higher prices or in short weights.\"[4] According to one linguistics book, \"The gold in this phrase originally described the golden hue of the leaves on the marijuana plant, but later came to refer both to the high quality of the marijuana and to the especially high price it commanded.\"[5] Acapulco by itself can be used as a synonym for marijuana, generally referring to a high-grade type like Acapulco gold.[4][5] The similarly named Acapulco red, refers to a reddish-brown marijuana grown near Acapulco, Mexico with reddish tops on the plants.[5]"},

Sometimes, with 100% pure skunk varieties bred for indoor grow conditions it can be difficult to get good results when the plants are grown outdoors. Dutch Passion hybridised a carefully selected Skunk with a tough Indica strain to create Trance. Trance is an F1 hybrid which has come out as a particularly good quality variety that matures earlier than most. Outdoors it may be fully ripened by the end of September or 2nd week of October. Plants may reach 1-1.5m tall and can produce large leaves. Occasionally the plants turn a remarkable and beautiful red colour and deliver an excellent quality high that lasts for 2-3 hours. THC levels are 12-13% which is ample for a top quality supply of weed which retains the genuine skunk taste and flavours. Users report Trance is ideal for connecting with mother earth and making tantric spiritual journeys of the mind and soul. Trance is a strong reliable outdoor Skunk hybrid that has been popular with outdoor growers for many years. The high delivers a good quality, deep and escapist stone that will allow your mind and body to break away from the 21st century confines and find a true inner peace."},

Like many other popular and trendy strains, its name recognition was used for false advertising for marketing other, unrelated strains. There has also been quite a bit of confusion about its pedigree. Many have incorrectly associated it with Grand Daddy Purp and Cherry Pie. Genuine GSC is descended from indica-dominant OG Kush and sativa F1 Durban Poison. This gives it its prized hybrid qualities, combining physical relaxation with a mental high. OG Kush and Durban Poison hybrid cross whose reputation grew too large to stay within the borders of its California homeland. With a sweet and earthy aroma, Girl Scout Cookies launches you to euphoria\\u2019s top floor where full-body relaxation meets a time-bending cerebral space. A little goes a long way with this hybrid, whose THC heights have won Girl Scout Cookies numerous Cannabis Cup awards. Patients needing a strong dose of relief, however, may look to GSC for severe pain, nausea, and appetite loss. There are several different phenotypes of the Girl Scout Cookies strain including Thin Mint and Platinum Cookies, which exhibit some variation in appearance and effect. Typically, however, Girl Scout Cookies expresses its beauty in twisting green calyxes wrapped in purple leaves and fiery orange hairs.

The people of these regions are a patchwork of Turkic, Tajik, Afghan and Pashtun tribes, and the history of Mazar-i-Sharif strains is likely to be equally complex. In fertile and well-irrigated soils these vigorous giants are capable of reaching 4 metres in height or more, and will produce a similarly immense yield of intensely resinous flowers. Traditionally harvested in the first half of December with the onset of the brutal Central Asian winter, Mazar-i-Sharif plants will enjoy cold conditions, including snow, and will turn a deep blood red in low temperatures. Growers favour leaving harvest as late as possible, sometimes into early January. Sieved \"Milk of Mazar\" garda is very resinous and so can be hand-pressed to make charas; it has a distinctively pungent, sweet aroma and a dreamily mellow high.
