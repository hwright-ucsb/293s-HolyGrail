Arguably the most famous West Coast strain of all time. I've been a cannabis smoker for quite a few years now and never actually came across this strain, so when i finally got my hands on it, it was a happy day. This strain has to live up to a lot because of its legendary status, and I wasn't quite expecting the high that followed smoking two bong bowls of this sticky beauty, but I was nonetheless very pleased. Many people will rate a marijuana strain on how potent it is, or how intense the high that follows is, but for me this isn't how I rate a strain. Sure its great when you get one of those crazy strong strains that you only have smoke one bowl of to get too baked to stand, but honestly I think there's more to cannabis medicine than that. For me, I was expecting an extremely potent strain when I finally got my hands on this flower, but what I discovered was something different. This strain isn't the most potent out there (though it is definitely very decently powerful) but what makes this strain so legendary is the kind of high it gives you.  In my opinion it is the perfect balance between the sativa and indica highs, and leaves you feeling, happy, euphoric, and focused, yet very relaxed, but not heavy or tired. It doesn't give you couch lock but it also doesn't make you feel the need to run around. It gives a nice head high but nothing that would prevent you from doing normal activities (unless of course you smoke a lot) as well as a nice body high that makes you feel uplifted and almost like you're floating. This to me is the perfect all around strain, that is good for all kinds of smokers, Indica and Sativa lovers alike, good for night and daytime use, and good for any activity, from going on a hike to smoking before bed. I think this is what has launched Blue Dream into its legendary status. The taste is also exceptional, very sweet and reminiscent of blueberries, as its name would suggest, as well as a hint of grape. It also had a nice burn to it, not too harsh, but still that nice cannabis smoke feeling in the back of the throat. I would recommend this strain to absolutely anyone, especially first time users, as I feel it gives a very good overall perspective on what cannabis really is. It was the definition of Cloud Nine. I loved it.","strain":"blue-dream","user":"Recklessescapee","stars":"4.5","date":"10/29/2014 12:27 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Focused","Happy","Relaxed","Uplifted","Dry Eyes","Berry","Blueberry","Sweet","Grape"],"ID":"235280"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Taste is awesome.

Of course, negative effects can occur but you can really push your limits with this one. To really get what makes this strain unique, I'd recommend smoking more than you think. On that note, I feel that the high tapers fairly quickly with this strain, so you may have to indulge at tighter intervals than you're used to. \n\nLike others have indicated, the high is very euphoric. You'll find yourself smiling, dancing, and generally feeling very pleasant. Even if your buzz lingers into bedtime, I found it makes falling asleep enjoyable. However, stimulation readily overpowers the euphoria. For this reason, it may be a better strain for camping outdoors rather than a night in. \n\nEffect on entertainment - 3/5\nI found that this strain is not as good at others at making movies seem fantastic. This was especially true for horror films, as it made decidedly them less frightening (boo!). Video games remain fun. \n\nEffect on eating - 3/5\nIt has an average effect on enhancing flavors. It is very similar to common mid-level stuff.\n\nEffect on <3 - 3.5/5\nIt makes for decent romantic excursions but other strains are better. It's a bit libido sapping and brings out silly behavior.\n\nConsumption notes: \nVaporized 1/8 using both the EZ Vape 5 (@ 280-300) and the WISPR2 over the course of several weeks.","strain":"northern-lights","user":"jamesbrowneffect","stars":"4","date":"10/28/2014 7:09 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Euphoric","Happy","Energetic"],"ID":"235338"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"cat-piss","user":"cjm95","stars":"4","date":"10/28/2014 8:09 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"235339"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This strain is an exceptional Indica type of Marijuana, it is mostly found in Netherlands, where it is used to help with Headaches, Insomnia, Fatigue, and more.

I call it \"teflon weed\". Smoke this and old problems/stress/self-doubt all melt away. I had no coordination issues (example: bumping into things, moving too fast... or too slow, no dizziness at all). I forgot to check my eyes for redness but they didn't feel \"puffy\" at all, nor dry. Felt it a little in my face around the eyes but no body effects... except for a very \"relaxed feeling\"... I felt strangely disconnected from my body.\n\nI think you can smoke this all day... even before bedtime (give yourself 1 hour). It doesn't tire me out at all, but relaxes you so much that sleep becomes easy... if that makes any sense. Didn't feel particularly hungry either. Had a bowl of cereal while high and the \"act of eating\" was quite pleasurable.... but i'm sure fruits/veggies would have done the trick as well.\n\nDuring a workday, this is nice weed. If daytime, I prefer this high to, say, Northern Lights (I've had the \"atomic\" version or ANL).  ANL makes me dizzy and wanna eat sweet/salty/spicy stuff... better for weekends with beer and BBQ. Westnern Winds (Kali Mist) is way more functional than ANL... good for workdays.\n\nI felt no anxiety, no paranoia, no \"nervouseness\" at all. Instead, I got into a really good mood on this stuff (felt like nothing could bother me). When speaking to my wife, I realized I was a little smiley/giggly as well (more than normal)... I think this would be good socializing weed. At the same time... there's no euphoria. You're not \"flying\" on this... you're \"cruizin' \"... at 60 on a straight highway in perfect weather. \n\nWhat I really liked was that I was completely functional on this. I read a report while high and understood everything I was reading... short term memory seemed unaffected. I didn't feel lazy at all just SUPER RELAXED... didn't have a preference for either staying still/sitting down or going somewhere... nice!\n\nOverall, I wouldn't call it \"DA BEST\" weed I've smoked (but, then again, that's such a personal thing). I found that it was not \"high\" enough for me, especially given that's it's classified as a sativa. (I've recently tasted Malawi Gold - a pure african landrace sativa)... it was the most \"uplifting/thought provoking/creative/\"feel like you're in a parallel dimension\" weed I've ever tried... amazing stuff)... but I couldn't smoke that and be able to work. On workdays, Western Winds is close to perfection.\n\nI will try this again.","strain":"kali-mist","user":"Deetom","stars":"4","date":"10/29/2014 4:28 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Focused","Giggly","Relaxed","Talkative"],"ID":"235758"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"bay-11","user":"bubbakushj","stars":"4","date":"10/29/2014 6:35 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Focused"],"ID":"235759"},{"_type":"dict","content":"My all time favorite.

Being a lightweight and this being a new strain to me, I smoked a very small joint (.1g) to myself after a walk to a nearby convenience store (1-2 minutes from home) and then went home. I felt the effects almost immediately - after a minute or so of walking I felt what some may describe as a body buzz (I'm not super experienced so I'm not sure if that's what this was) I felt very light, as if I was walking on a cloud or just floating. It didn't cause me to stumble or anything, and I made it home fine.\n\nI walked in about 5 minutes after finishing my pinner, fiending for the pomegranate that I had prepared before leaving in anticipation of getting the munchies. Unfortunately, my mom asked me to help her with the laundry unexpectedly, so I went straight to the basement and started sorting hangers and folding hot towels from the dryer. Among the metal wire hangers and couple wooden ones was this weird matte-plastic hanger that really tripped me out when I touched it. The feeling of it seemed so unnatural to me that I actually stopped and asked my mom to feel it and tell me if it felt weird (she said it didn't). The towels were fresh from the dryer, so they were pretty hot, and they made my hands/fingers tingle as I was folding them. By the time I'd finished the laundry, it'd been about 20 minutes since I finished smoking. Just as I finished, the thought of a cucumber popped into my head for no reason, and the taste filled my mouth. I could imagine it so vividly that on my way up to my room I grabbed an entire cucumber and brought it upstairs to eat with my pomegranate. I devoured the cucumber, ate the entire bowl of pomegranate, then ate the half bag of chips that was sitting on my computer desk, along with a litre of Pepsi. I then frantically ran around my house desperately looking for more food. It's about time to go grocery shopping, so the house is pretty much dry. I found a stray package of cookies with 5-10 left, killed those, and then gave up on my search.\n\nI spent the rest of my night playing video games (League of Legends), telling a close friend of mine how important she was to me and that she was gorgeous after she asked me how I thought of her looks when I mentioned that another friend told me to try and date her after seeing some of her pictures. I was really affectionate and at the same time really enjoying my League matches, playing with her and a few other friends.

I've been HIV+ for almost 30 years.  The absolute worst symptoms I've been had for over 10 years are depression & mind-numbing fatigue.  Fatigue so bad I couldn't get out of bed.  And depression resulting from being able to not think clearly, as though my mind was full of cobwebs.  And that worst part of depression:  not getting joy from things that used to give you joy.  Focusing on negatives things which happened long ago.  Feeling bitter and resentful.  Basically, just waiting to die.\n\nWhite Fire OG has completely turned all that around.  I've tried every anti-depressant out there, nothing even comes close.   I have a mini-bong (I found at amazon.com) and about 2 hits of bud is fine for me.  It  gives a sense of euphoria, but not hallucinogenic.  Perhaps if I took more, I would, I don't know. \n\nI've been taking it for about 2 months now, and I thank GOD for it.  I just wish it was legal a long time ago, I may have avoided 2 suicide attempts.\n\nI'm enjoying life again, I'm getting out of the house, meeting people and going to the gym.  I have my life back again.  It's wonderful.\n\nThanks to everyone who voted to make marijuana legal medicinally in California.  It should be legal recreationally as well.

That's the only smell you get from it. Next is taste. I'm waiting for my vaporizer to arrive in the mail, so I did my first session with RB Kush through a pipe. I will do a re-review with the Vaporizer. Anyways, even from smoking, I sill got an unexpected surprise. I was expecting a nice root beer smell and more earthy tastes, I instead got the taste of amazing root beer. The toke starts off quite earthy, but when that dies off, each toke has a fantastic root beer finish taste. When smoking this, all of my saliva tasted like root beer. It was cool. The high from this is progressing. I actually write reviews when experiencing the product. So I'm 3 bowls in, and I'm feeling more mellowed out. I am a lighter weight smoker, so do take that into consideration. My face feels very heavy on the rest of my head. It's an extremely mellow, happy high. I can feel the body  high indica effects getting stronger. The becomes more mellow as I become more and more high. The body effects and the taste really mesh well for some reason. I am getting some more minor cotton mouth, but I think's it's because the rootbeer taste is making me salivate a lot.\n\nAnyways, this isn't the strongest weed out there, by any means. It gives you a decent functioning body high, that frees your mind for a bit and let's you explore things outside of the box. I would reccomend this strain for people suffering from anxiety or depression, and definitely for recreational users who want a very mellow, happy chill sesh with your buds or alone before bed. Solid 3.5/5.\n\nI WILL RE REVIEW WITH THE ASCENT VAPORIZER SOON.","strain":"root-beer-kush","user":"AcidBlitz","stars":"3.5","date":"10/31/2014 4:16 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Happy","Relaxed","Sleepy","Dry Mouth","Earthy","Sweet","Vanilla"],"ID":"237130"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Smoke this, you must.

The resin production is heavy, sparkling; flowers a medium-heavy overall density; impressive for the strong sativa presentation in character. Genetics show 60/40 sat./ind. but the effect is more 80/20.\n\nEffect onset is rapid, strong, and noticeably prolonged; > 30 minutes. Mood lifting with dimensionality, glee; uncommonly so. Above average relief for chronic pain; fibromyalgia, arthritis, etc. I would highly recommend this as a low-dose medicine; not for novice or casual patients.\n\nI would not recommend this for muscle tension or anxiety as the high energy level may wind people up. While less paranoia-inducing than other especially high thc strains, this is a strong medicine that has the ability to surprise a regular user of high quality cannabis. Start with one or two medium pulls; don't rip it.\n\nThere is a markedly higher ceiling with Truth along with a much more comprehensive medicinal and theraputic profile than most.\n\nHowever the science of terpenes and cbd is mixed within this hybrid, its something distinct and uniquely beneficial; second most effective medicine I have had in the past decade.","strain":"the-truth","user":"saiamne","stars":"5","date":"10/31/2014 6:53 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Energetic","Euphoric","Happy","Relaxed","Talkative","Uplifted","Sweet","Flowery","Violet","Earthy","Pungent","Skunk"],"ID":"237450"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Best Smoke So Far.

Got of gram of this from a WA recreational shop. Medium green buds with some orange hairs and a nice coating of frost (19% THC). There's not much info on the internet—no real record of this strain, and the producer, Emerald Twist, doesn't have a website.  Potent, but not devastating. Sativa notes come through in the high, but was more relaxing than energizing. I smoked a pipe bowl (3 good long hits), and after about 5 minutes I felt a buzzing/tension in the temple and forehead area. 10 minutes in, began to feel general relaxation—a very nice body buzz and attitude adjustment with neither couch lock nor sleepiness. The high intensifies for about 30 minutes and levels off, resulting in a fuzzy, relaxed, mellow high. Has a nice gradual come-down and doesn't leave you feeling fatigued like some strains can. Puts you in the zone for watching sports or movies, as you can focus—and maintain focus—on a narrative and comprehend it.  This weed works on my headaches, but only for as long as the high lasts -- 1.5 - 2 hrs. I imagine it is also great campfire weed. Not too trippy, not too chatty, story-telling weed. This does not produce strong muchies, and beer and wine are excellent with it. Pretty standard dry mouth and dry eye effects, especially on the back end. \n\nGrower: Emerald Twist, Inc.","strain":"0457f6d9-e2c4-4d12-b23c-309fc2af957b","user":"asparagusfive","stars":"3.5","date":"10/31/2014 10:24 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Focused","Relaxed","Dry Mouth","Dry Eyes"],"ID":"238123"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Good strain lots of head high not much body though","strain":"amnesia-haze","user":"koburu","stars":"4","date":"10/31/2014 11:17 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric"],"ID":"238124"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"bc-big-bud","user":"neckface","stars":"4","date":"11/1/2014 12:21 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize"],"ID":"238125"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Si te quieres reir con tus amigos es la mejor","strain":"somango","user":"gonchi","stars":"4","date":"11/1/2014 1:42 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"238126"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Soothing.

I would experience this with both indicas and sativas alike. It became so common for me to have a bad high that I gave up smoking weed at all because the negatives began to outweigh the positives. Enter Cannatonic! My boyfriend ordered this especially for me, and after trying it once I've smoked it in the evenings almost every single day since, with no negative effects except for some dry mouth/eyes. \n\nWhen I smoke a little of this I immediately relax, and often experience a powerful euphoria.

These components are responsible for the medicinal effect of these plants. THC also has an effect of causing a feel of high which has lead to labelling them as addictive drugs. However, studies have shown that the adverse effects of the medical marijuana are far less that those synthetic pharmaceuticals, and in fact have a diverse set of benefits. Don’t always believe what the media says.\nMedical Marijuana has been legalized in 23 States of US which includes CA. This has been a blessing for the patients in Los Angeles, Hollywood, and West Hollywood. With so much technology, and such entrepreneurial mindsets, services exist that really focus on the convenience of the patients. For example, patients can now legally procure medical marijuana without ever physically visiting any dispensary. To really understand, and take advantage of such delivery services, please visit http://www.thepluglosangeles.com/.\nMedical marijuana can be found as the perfect “go-to” for medical conditions like asthma, epilepsy, anxiety, nausea, and it has also scientifically proven to reduce the advancement of certain types of cancer. Medical marijuana also plays a vital role in the treatment of AIDS.\nThere are more than 200 different strains of medical marijuana and they are divided mainly into Indica and Sativa strains. However, there is a blend of the two strains. The hybrid types, which have the combination of both Indica and Sativa, with varied proportions to obtain the desired outcome. Before deciding on which strain to go for, you need to be sure of the desired effect. A higher proportion of Indica may give you a “heavy head.” At the same time a higher proportion of the Sativa strains will give you a clear head and an uplifting body effect.

These components are responsible for the medicinal effect of these plants. THC also has an effect of causing a feel of high which has lead to labelling them as addictive drugs. However, studies have shown that the adverse effects of the medical marijuana are far less that those synthetic pharmaceuticals, and in fact have a diverse set of benefits. Don’t always believe what the media says.\nMedical Marijuana has been legalized in 23 States of US which includes CA. This has been a blessing for the patients in Los Angeles, Hollywood, and West Hollywood. With so much technology, and such entrepreneurial mindsets, services exist that really focus on the convenience of the patients. For example, patients can now legally procure medical marijuana without ever physically visiting any dispensary. To really understand, and take advantage of such delivery services, please visit http://www.thepluglosangeles.com/.\nMedical marijuana can be found as the perfect “go-to” for medical conditions like asthma, epilepsy, anxiety, nausea, and it has also scientifically proven to reduce the advancement of certain types of cancer. Medical marijuana also plays a vital role in the treatment of AIDS.\nThere are more than 200 different strains of medical marijuana and they are divided mainly into Indica and Sativa strains. However, there is a blend of the two strains. The hybrid types, which have the combination of both Indica and Sativa, with varied proportions to obtain the desired outcome. Before deciding on which strain to go for, you need to be sure of the desired effect. A higher proportion of Indica may give you a “heavy head.” At the same time a higher proportion of the Sativa strains will give you a clear head and an uplifting body effect.  For more details regarding the different strains please visit http://www.thepluglosangeles.com/menu/.\nOnce you have decided on your strain, we can supply the product with the least formalities and fastest delivery.

(Now you know the \"setting.\") If someone were here, I would talk to them, but slower and more causally than I usually talk. I now notice I'm not bothered by either back or upper leg pain. So, for me, there is pain relief. I have no problem forming thoughts and sentences. I can type. I tend to come up with \"outside the box\" ideas when I'm in this relaxed state.

My personal preference is a Sativa dominate Hybrid that brings focus, a clear head and uplifts my energy level.  Mother's Helper totally works for me to aide with anxiety, muscle tension, fatigue, lower back pain.  It has a calming effect that makes me want to get up and do something.  Not a fan of couch surfing unless I'm done for the day and ready to crash.  I lean more toward Kush strains for that.  THC levels on the Monarch website are listed at 17-22% for MH.\n\nNot the greatest at picking out flavors and smells but Mother's Helper, once I pinched it, smelled very sweet and fruity.  I thought Blueberry and Peach.  Taste is good.  Got a little of the sweetness when I hit it but I am sure a good vape would help bring out the flavor.  I would say it is more of a head \"high\".  Like energy is collecting there for some reason.  Hitting it hard, like a couple bowls would knock me out.  I am a small bowl kinda dude and usually use a one hitter for general use.  Haven't vaped any yet so..  This is a great strain to use during the day or if you need a 4th Quarter Push at night, Mother's Helper would be what I would choose in that event.\n\nOne thing I noticed for me  is, Mother's Helper is kind of like a wave ride.  The reason I say that is because the high feeling drifts down to a point where you think you need to take another hit but then all of a sudden, you are feeling it again.  So try savoring it initially. MH comes on strong but in a good way.  I don't like feeling stoned and I don't feel out if it even if I take that extra drag.   So if you like a Hybrid that is gets you up off the couch, then I would highly recommend the aptly named Mother's Helper as she definitely takes care of me.  5 stars from budsimple.com.","strain":"73f4e1f4-28ec-43d6-9f2a-f1588f5407da","user":"budsimple","stars":"5","date":"11/5/2014 1:10 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Energetic","Focused","Happy","Uplifted","Blueberry","Peach","Flowery"],"ID":"239762"},{"_type":"dict","content":"My hubby picked some of this up.

The high is strong and full-bodied - starting in the head and melting into a full body euphoria; I find it leans towards the Indica side of things, but can still be very suitable for any time of day.

As an edible, I experienced some paranoia as well as delusional thought processes, but this may be due to the likely overdose. Which, as many know, is rather easy to do with edibles.

GTR recommended this strain to me, and has it listed as a sativa, so I was skeptical. This is by far my favorite tasting strain as of yet, it DOES taste and smell just like guava fruit! Trying things for pain management, this helps, and I've had experience with other hybrids giving me worse headaches on top of the one I was trying to get rid of, but this doesn't do that.

When I opened the bag I thought I was suddenly on a camping trip. It smelled like a Christmas tree , the order was earthy and strong. A whiff of skunk soon followed to convince my olfactory system that I had not been ripped off. The dry , yet spongy texture was almost white from the THC frosty goodness. Breaking the bud into my pipe was a pleasant experience as it released more of the earthy , skunky scent into my face. It burned rather quickly but fogged well. The taste of pine , clove and earth danced across across my palate whisking a cool smoke into my lungs. I had an instant head feeling that was the equivalent of a cup of espresso. Very smooth smoke. After one more bowl I began to feel the sedative effects that calmed my nerves and loosened my muscles. About 20 min after the second bowl I was well on my way.

How weird!\n\nIt erases your mind immediately, yet you're strangely still able to focus and express yourself. Hah, man...what is up with this high? I'm really liking how DIFFERENT it feels from most other strains.\n\nHead is in a cloud both physically and mentally...yet Bubba's awesome presence still cuts through somehow. Pretty couch-locky in that your body feels rooted and it'd take a lot of motivation (that you don't have) to get up.\n\nIt's the kind of high where you're especially in your own head -but so gone nothing has time to sink in. So, at the will of your whims. Not the safest or easiest of highs. Definitely has noticeable edge throughout (thanks Sour D).\n\nDue to the couch lock and edginess, I can't recommend for daytime, hiking, being active, in public, or socializing. And since Sour D's not great for accentuating movies/music/art, you can do much better with other strains. It does succeed as a wholly unique high that'll trip you the fuck out.

Don't have insurance, either. So, I started looking into alternatives--flash forward to the present: right now. I was gifted this strain by a friend of mine who recommended it to start off with. I enjoyed it with a new glass pipe and was instantly tingly. Didn't take long for me to think that color was brighter, sharper and felt very relaxed yet focused at the same time. The first day and first high I had nearly caught up on an entire week's worth of missed housework and able to maintain that kind of energy the entire day well after the high passed. This is definitely better than I remember smoking when I was a kid, and I highly recommend it to my fellow diabetics and depression sufferers. \n\nA small side note: I assume if I could afford it, getting a vaporizer will help, but in the meantime, all I have is the glass hand-blown pipe and I've found that I've had to take it slow with this.

Definitely helped with anxiety and nausea, but increased paranoia a bit.\n\nThe reason I am rating 4 stars instead of 5 is because it helped everything except my obsessive compulsions.

It is hands down the best high I have ever had.  It wasn't influenced by getting high with my friends or having an experience or anything.  I sat at home, ate dinner and watched a movie.....and yet it beat every strain I have ever tried which include:\nMr. Nice, \nBubba Kush, \nGirl Scout Cookies, \nGod's Gift, \nLemon Drop, \nSuper Lemon Haze, \nACDC, \nPlatinum Bubba Kush, \nMaui Waui, \nBlack Cherry Soda, \nEmperor's Cut, \nBlack Mamba, \nLouis XIII, \nThe Hulk, \nEuphoria, \nCannatonic, \nDeath Star OG, \nLemon OG Kush, \nBlue Dream, \n\nEach strain has offered me relief in different ways and their purpose has differed depending on what I need it for.  I am diagnosed Type 2 Bipolar.  I am also ADD.  I currently take Adderal for my ADD and Lamictal which is a mood stabilizer for Bipolar.  The Lamictal causes MASSIVE depression and suicidal thoughts.  I don't want to go on another Anti-Depressant like I have in the past (if you have been down that road, you know what I'm talking about).  My depression has been HEAVY and very painful physically as well as mentally.  I have been looking for the right strain for a LONG time and finally....FINALLY....this is it.  The euphoria I feel on it makes me feel like the good old me before I started taking pills....I feel amazing without the downfalls of mania.  In a span of 30 minutes, I went from a crushing headache, having crying fits and suicidal thoughts to being the happiest I have been in months.  I was totally removed from my dark depression and into a place that not only put life into it's proper perspective but allowed me to experience the highs I used to feel.  All the weight melted away and even though my night was super mundane, it was a perfect night by myself.\n\nAnother thing to mention is that I have ALWAYS considered myself an indica guy.  I am EXTREMELY sensitive to weed (anything that starts with a super, king, platinum, etc. or ends with an \"OG\" is always a bad time for me.  I had a terrible trip on \"Blue Dream\" and even threw up when smoking the strain \"Euphoria\".  Sativa's have been brutal to me!).  But Lamb's Bread is it!  Look, if you are looking to have some crazy trip, there are plenty of other strains out there that will give you just that.  I legitimately use weed as a medical purpose....which is why I am writing this to everyone.  \n\nIf you suffer from Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar or ADD, this strain is perfect.  Look no further.  It's clear enough to focus and carry on conversations easily but not so clear where it almost becomes harsh.  The first half of this high is mostly head high....but the second half....wow....what a body high!  I felt AMAZING on this.  No headaches like Girl Scout Cookies, Super Lemon Haze, etc.  can bring on.  The first half is energetic and the second half has a small sleepy effect.  Could have been cause it was getting late...but amazing that I have the option of smoking a sativa at night and being able to go to bed on it if I want!  \n\nI can't recommend this strain enough!  The only other strain that comes close is either Maui Waui or Mr. Nice...but even then they don't even compare to Lambs Bread!","strain":"lamb-s-bread","user":"MrUnicorn","stars":"5","date":"11/14/2014 10:30 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Euphoric","Focused","Creative","Happy","Uplifted","Relaxed","Hungry","Aroused","Tingly","Giggly","Energetic","Sleepy","Earthy"],"ID":"247275"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"critical-skunk","user":"rickyfonty","stars":"4","date":"11/14/2014 10:55 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Dry Mouth","Happy","Relaxed","Uplifted"],"ID":"247276"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Definitely a solid strain, after maybe .5 my anxiety was gone completely and I felt great.

I am not disappointed!\n\nI found this made cleaning my house much more enjoyable.  But I do notice that if I'm a bit tired, or if I relax to watch a movie or TV show, it's likely that I'll fall asleep.  It also very nicely helps with my muscle pain (TMJ, neck, shoulders).\n\nAs for cerebral effects, if I'm chilling or watching something stimulating (Cosmos), my brain becomes very creative and I can understand complex ideas quite easily.

Does NOT cause anywhere near the level of head high or paranoia. A few downsides: you only get the full effects if you smoke (not vape) it, you have to smoke a lot of it if you really want it to knock you out, and it will build up your tolerance very quickly. Your eyes will get red but you will not feel them getting dry - it's weird. I often and if I were to smoke a bowl of a Sativa-dominant standard \"got it from some guy\" weed I would get really paranoid, yet I can smoke three straight bowls of this.  A very small hit in the morning while your coffee is brewing can be nice.\n\n\nLike most good indicas I have encountered it has a fairly pleasant smell that isn't unbelievably pungent, and I would kinda say it's an earthy flowery smell that's Lavender-y. \n\n\nVendor spelled it as Herojuana but specifically used seeds that are spelled as Herijuana so I can assure you it is the same strain: a strong indica that's  \"Killer New Haven x Petrolia Headstash\"","strain":"herojuana","user":"Diogenes","stars":"5","date":"11/15/2014 11:29 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Sleepy","Happy","Lavender","Flowery"],"ID":"247914"},{"_type":"dict","content":"lemon-ee diesel smell & taste with a headband high and more of an auto-pilot feel.","strain":"white-fire-alien-og","user":"youngstang","stars":"4","date":"11/16/2014 12:33 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Focused","Relaxed","Sleepy","Tingly","Uplifted","Citrus","Lemon","Flowery","Earthy","Woody","Chemical","Diesel"],"ID":"247915"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"black-domina","user":"Eric420","stars":"4","date":"11/16/2014 12:56 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Hungry","Euphoric","Sleepy","Relaxed","Dry Mouth","Pungent","Nutty","Citrus"],"ID":"247916"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Very excellent smoke, not too harsh.

In order to truly know what helps, I have to be willing (and I am) to withstand discomfort and/or pain, misery n the whole ball of wax.  For instance, when the nausea suddenly slams me, forget logic.  It goes out the window.  I go into out-of-control over-drive and start throwing everything at it that I can think of, which is usually Promethazine; I search online, frantically, for which strain will work the best for nausea, but it's not as straightforward as that...what you find online is not as straightforward, is what I meant.  That's been my experience thus far.  I'm hoping my luck will change and that I happen across the most user-friendly, most comprehensive PERFECT LOL strain for me for nausea.\nToday, I have taken a Prom, and smoked a little bit of other stuff, BUT even tho it could be coincidence, I do feel better now.  I started feeling better in the first few moments after smoking Agent Orange with Green Crack Kief and I'm writing this (that's HUGE), so I'd say it's safe to claim \"focus\" for this one as well.\nI'm about to smoke the other half.

It smells amazing, nearly out of this world! In my opinion the pungent sour lemon smell is honestly the best. The taste is almost just like the smell, but with more of the OG Kush's earthy and piney undertones, which definitely become more recognizable while smoking or vaping this strain.\n     Sour OG also has some very good medicinal uses. I personally have crippling anxiety and depression, and this strain helps me through the daily roller-coaster that is life. Whenever I'm high off of this strain, my whole world lights up and really lets me socialize and function with society. It helps me be a better person and gives me the energy to go do something with my day.   \n     As someone who uses cannabis regularly, I love having different strains to choose from when buying, and Sour OG is a strain I always love getting from my dealer. These are reasons why it gets 5 stars from me. \n\nTL;DR: SMOKE THIS RIGHT NOW [7]","strain":"sour-og","user":"PaulieL","stars":"5","date":"11/18/2014 3:27 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Creative","Energetic","Focused","Relaxed","Hungry","Happy","Uplifted","Sweet","Citrus","Lemon","Earthy","Pungent","Skunk","Spicy/Herbal"],"ID":"248716"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Called \"Sweet Skunk\" at my dispensary.

I'm not paranoid and I feel like I could eat a race horse AND it's jocky. My head seems to but floating smoothly from thought to thought instead of them colliding together. I get really anxious but this strain has me worry free and happy with life.

It is rare to encounter a strain like this. First, the potency is phenomenal. Even with a high tolerance, it produced a lot of the classic anxiety symptoms (increased heart rate, mild paranoia, general anxiety) that many people experience from potent strains. It also produced mild visual and auditory distortion, in addition to a feeling of euphoric happiness. Again, these effects were in an experienced smoker. Second, it has a wonderful smell and smoke. The odor of the plant is rather sweet though difficult to fully describe, but the odor of the smoke and burnt material is strongly reminiscent of hashish or other concentrates.\n\nI can only imagine that in a less frequent or more inexperienced smoker, this would produce an overwhelmingly intense psychedelic effect for a couple of hours. For the experienced smoker, this promises a relatively intense effect with (in my experience) a longer-than-average duration. It is absolutely not the right choice for people who have or are prone to experiencing anxiety, or for people who do not prefer high potency or psychedelic components to their cannabis experience. For everyone else, if you can find it for a reasonable price at a reputable dispensary, I strongly recommend it.","strain":"lsd","user":"Doktor_Sleepless","stars":"5","date":"11/20/2014 11:29 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Euphoric","Creative","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"250013"},{"_type":"dict","content":"leaves a very great relaxed feeling while being able to not be couch locked. all around fantastic strain, one of my favorites.","strain":"blue-dream","user":"Zyngi","stars":"5","date":"11/21/2014 1:19 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Hungry","Relaxed","Uplifted","Sweet","Blueberry","Earthy"],"ID":"250014"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"papaya","user":"Framnetgear","stars":"5","date":"11/21/2014 2:11 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Focused","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Talkative","Uplifted","Tropical","Flowery","Earthy","Spicy/Herbal"],"ID":"250015"},{"_type":"dict","content":"One of the best all body high I ever had\n","strain":"jack-herer","user":"jrmoo","stars":"5","date":"11/21/2014 3:13 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"250016"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-dream","user":"FATA","stars":"4","date":"11/21/2014 3:49 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy","Uplifted","Talkative","Sleepy","Relaxed","Hungry","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"250017"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Typically u would rate this one low because while its a good high I usually pass the fuck out every time I smoked it.

But okay\" about 2 minutes later the giggles kick in. around the 10 minute mark it really starts to hit you hard. Hence the name Trainwreck. Feels amazing but you get baked as fuck off a little bit. good feeling of being light headed, not sketchy but chill. Whole body felt funny. Feels trippy but still fully aware and remember it all Then either super talkative or silent. When you come down, its really subtle. No harsh drop or dizziness. It just slowly fades. Towards the end or about an hour or so into your high, you just feel ready to pass out from being tired. Can last between 3-12 hours we noticed. \n\nmy experience: super giggles. laughed at the dumbest shit you could imagine. motor skills and basic comprehension were non existing. couldn't even figure out how to put the cap back on my juice. couldn't figure out how to hold things in each hand. Talking like a happy confused little kid. I would NOT shut up. but remained fully aware of everything and remember it clearly. felt amazing. 2 solid puffs gave me a good buzz. One joint did me in. Hence my name \"lyt3w8\" my high lasted about 4-8 hours depending on how much I took.\n\nmy bro from Hope: he picked this up directly from the grower. Fresh picked that day. He was insanely chill. didn't talk much but just wanted to play with stuff in his hands. started out calm and well aware. hadn't hit him yet but after the 10/15 min mark, eyes were super red. barely keep his eyes open, and would still laugh like an idiot if provoked. 2 joints did him in. But he's also a heavyweight. \n\nmy other friend: she started out as the \"paranoid\" type. Freaking out then just got mad hungry. Then slowly transitioned into the \"amazed by everything\" type. Then finally into the laughing at anything that she sees. She is also a lightweight. One joint did her in. \n\nThat night we shared 2 joints between the 3 of us. 2 was the most any of us could handle within about 30 minutes. \n\nAll in all, this strain affects everyone differently. I highly recommend you give it a shot. \n\nSo, after going through about 5 joints with my bro over the last 2 days, I can say this is my favorite strain I've ever tried. \n\nLooking forward to vaping it!

I researched and researched and decided to make Blue Magoo my first try.\n\nWhen I was younger I smoked a lot for recreation, but I'm way past that, so I'm truly looking for pain relief. My philosophy is that this is medicine and so I need to find the smallest possible dose that helps me feel better.\n\nI started (as a guess) with two hits off my vaporizer, and that was a good guess. My migraine subsides in minutes and I don't really get \"high\". I do get some very nice body relaxation (including relaxing my shoulders and neck, which are always tight and sore). I also notice that my mind is more \"clear\" at that dosage. I'm ready to attack the day. So, from what I've read, more would probably make me tired (which would be fine). But the small amount I use for relief actually relaxes me, relieves the migraine and gives me good focus and energy for the day. Later I feel tired as it wears off, and that's fine.\n\nThough this is the least important to me... it does have a nice taste, especially on the exhale, and it's very smooth.\n\nThough I prefer CBD edibles as my daily maintenance for pain, Blue Magoo is definitely my \"go-to\" as my \"rescue inhaler\" for the onset of a migraine. It's worked every time, 3 times in a row. I have tried some other strains, and got good relief from the migraine, but also experienced effects I didn't want.\n\nSo... very nice. My favorite so far.","strain":"blue-magoo","user":"Narpet","stars":"3.5","date":"11/20/2014 7:10 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Focused","Happy","Relaxed"],"ID":"250127"},{"_type":"dict","content":"smokes well and nice mild piney taste!","strain":"jack-herer","user":"badboy742","stars":"3.5","date":"11/20/2014 10:10 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Happy","Relaxed","Dry Mouth","Woody"],"ID":"250128"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Nice and mellow but potent; buzz comes on quick and strong.

The effects are right up the alley that I look for when smoking.  Induces a immediate relaxed calming feeling, but after about 5-10 minutes you unexpectedly and almost instantaneously start experiencing intense euphoria alongside an initial energetic experience.  Also, expect to feel a warm, tingly, spa-like body buzz take you over after about 5-10 minutes.  There is definitely strong psychoactive thc effects and physical CBd induced effects felt.    You forget about time altogether.  I didn't look at the clock for about 2 1/2 hours after I smoked and I was still experiencing a extraordinary \"trip.\" I can honestly say that for 3 good hours I was in another world with absolute contentment and no worry whatsoever at all.  I also am a musician and this strain makes me very creative and tremendously appreciative towards all music.  It's not just music, anything that you involve yourself in or think about that you are passionate for will be enjoyed like you were experiencing it for the first time.  I have nothing but positive things to say about this strain.  Conclusively, after my 3-4 hours sojourning in another world, I came home to my nice warm bed, where I slept peacefully and uninterrupted for a superb 8 hours of sleep.  I woke up refreshed and ready to go to school.  \n\nOh, my friend who suffers from panic attack disorder really appreciated this strain.

It's not too hard on my throat, though I do get a bit of a tickle from time to time. I have also tried infusing cream with the previously vaped stuff. The effects didn't really change for me when I ate it; they just had a slower onset and longer duration.\n\nAt the levels I can tolerate, this strain relieves my pain roughly 10%. It does not help my nausea, and can even make that worse, if I take too much. At low levels, it makes me feel a bit jittery, happy, and talkative.

This is only my 2nd strain, so I'm not terribly discerning yet. I don't know anything about evaluating the quality of the bud, at all. But, I can say what my experience with JH has been.\n\nI found this strain to be pretty similar to Rene Mist, only more potent in some aspects, so I took lower doses. The smoke when I vapourize this is thicker, and harder on my throat. The flavour is a bitter, earthy tone that makes it hard for me to tell when it starts burning.\n\nAt the levels I can tolerate, this strain relieves my pain roughly 10%. It does not help my nausea, and can even make that significantly worse, if I take too much. It does make me a bit giddy, talkative, and peckish. I get tingly, too, as if my blood were fizzing, and this can make me jittery. Unfortunately, it also makes me dizzy (which hinders my ability to focus, and can be bad enough to keep me from moving my head), painfully dries out my eyes, and makes my mouth cottony (far more than the Rene Mist, so it's not just the hot air from vaping), which really takes away a lot of the flavour from food. Even my nose feels dried up.","strain":"jack-herer","user":"Aladrieth","stars":"2","date":"11/26/2014 9:06 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Happy","Hungry","Talkative","Tingly","Dizzy","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth","Earthy"],"ID":"253901"},{"_type":"dict","content":"One of my all time favorites!

I am not a regular cannabis user and generally fear the first few times I smoke because of the extreme effect that it can have on my behavior and outward appearance. Not so with Blue Dream. I have yet to try to get work done while high, however I have confidence that this strain is more of a work enabler than inhibitor. Regardless, it's good throughout the day. I wouldn't consume this strain before bed as it's too high-energy; but don't fear getting to sleep if you smoked it several hours before bed because it seems to wear off smoothly and result in a solid night's sleep. And as a bonus, the following morning I feel absolutely 110%. Everyone knows what a cannabis hangover feels like, and Blue Dream gives the opposite of a hangover.

I didn't much like high. Short-lived--maybe an hour and a half to two--and nothing too special. Though I am an Indica dominant fan (and I enjoy some sativas, too), this strain left me feeling anxious, \"blurry/foggy,\" unfocused, a little paranoid (the more you consume, the more paranoia), a headache and the munchies, followed by the case of the \"blahs\" (in other words, a flattening effect on emotions). It created for me a \"dull\" mindset; very distractable, and not a good strain if you're planning on being productive. You can tell it is mainly a sativa because there's a noticeable in congruency between the body and mind high--almost no body sensations associated with CBDs and CBNs). Again, these are my own personal subjective experiences. I have tried it a few times, at different times of day (because time of day does play a role in the effects of any given strain) using a vaporizer, and the effects are still disappointing and minuscule. Take into consideration that I am a seasoned smoker with a relatively high tolerance. If you live sativas that imbibe a social, energetic, fidgety high, you will like it.

It helps with the pain, although not as deeply as an Indica does for me (like Orion's Belt, which I like to take a puff of before bedtime).. it's more of a \"forget\" you're having pain feeling. I get very energetic and clean the house, work on projects that I've been putting off. I get very aware of my surroundings, like noticing things that are out of place or broke and need fixed, lol! So I'll fix things that I've been putting off, or never noticed before. I get very creative.. which works for me, since I'm self employed and do a lot of website and graphic design. It helps me concentrate and not focus so much on the negative things in my life, like my health and finances. \nIt gets me talking about anything and everything.. makes me feel happy, relaxed and outgoing. It causes me to say some of the funniest sh**.. and some of the most brilliant things! lol It starts working very quickly, takes only one hit for me, and lasts me for 4-5 hours.\nI especially like that Cinex is very SMOOTH and tastes good. It creates an after taste for me, similar to a sweet flowery tea.  \nI like that it doesn't cause any bad after effects for me, like I've had with other strains.

You get the best of both worlds:  the incredible flavours of Tangie backed with Chocolope.

From 6 fem seeds, we had one that turned out male - we were actually pretty happy about that as currently this strain is not available as regular seeds.  All plants perfectly uniform in every way (except the male, natch) so very pleased with first run of Tangilope.  Sure, the seeds are expensive, but well worth it IMO.

Someone was off getting high like Towlie when they needed to drying this and curing it better, but at $10 dollars a gram I can't bitch too much!\n\nCan't really speak about the taste of the bud itself without bringing up the mold issue. So, all things considered I like this strain, and provided I get a top shelf Lamb's Bread or similar Jamaican strain I will definitely get it.

My best friend was grounded for smelling overwhelmingly like weed. He had an eighth of SSH triple zip locked in his backpack...  Over the years I have been blessed to experience SSH produced by many different growers, from coast to coast. Though they all vary in structure, each and every one has the unmistakable Super Silver Scent. That piney, citrusy stink that fills a room in seconds, that punches your tongue, and makes your nose hairs stand on their ends. The kind of herb you save a little nugget of just to keep in a jar to smell from time to time. This is the only strain I have been able to identify on multiple occasions, purely based on smell with no indication SSH was even in the area. These genetics will always remain dear to my soul.

The feeling comes on quick but not too intense for someone who needs to get some work done. It starts with clearing your head providing a long lasting but mellow cerebral euphoria. Relaxation creeps into the body next followed with the ability to provide mild/moderate pain relief. I feel awake, functional, relaxed, and not too distracted.

I am so psyched about it, that I am going to go and relieve the pain, which is beginning to form in my back. this batch is especially pleasing to the senses, and works wonderful on pain. I would give it 4.3 on a 5 Point scale. No negative side effects just added to the pleasure, and I will buy this one again...Lucky","strain":"sweet-kush","user":"douglascaseychambers494727479","stars":"0.5","date":"12/7/2014 3:03 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Focused","Relaxed","Uplifted"],"ID":"258899"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This strain totally hit me in a way i've never been hit before it was amazing I had so much fun smoking this stuff with my buddies, tasted great and in my top 5 most definitely.","strain":"juicy-fruit","user":"kushbomb420","stars":"5","date":"12/7/2014 5:46 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Giggly","Relaxed","Happy","Talkative","Uplifted","Sleepy"],"ID":"258900"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blackberry-haze","user":"aurathief","stars":"4","date":"12/7/2014 4:21 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Tingly","Sweet","Berry","Citrus","Tropical","Pineapple","Mango","Flowery","Pungent"],"ID":"258901"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Your lemon kush is awesome.

(then there's \"NYC Sour Diesel\" with hazy and often-debated gentics that adds to the confusion) About half the Sour Diesel i've smoked (on the East and West Coast) has been very racy and extremely sativa-like in its effects - almost too racy for me, and i love super-sativas.  The other half of the Sour Diesel I've been smoking (this mostly from Cali) tends to have a more relaxing, medical side, with a bit of couch-lock if overripe, but overall what I would describe as a more pleasant experience.  It was also one of the very first strains I ever grew and was very rewarding and easy from a grower's perspective.  I love this stuff, it's all about finding 1 cultivator / dispensary / grower who you know is consistently selling the same exact diesel every time - they've got a bomb mother and they harvest proper and once you find that source stick with it.  Sour Diesel is all in the details, and like any EXTREMELY POPULAR strain, there are a sh*tload of variations you will encounter, from state to state, and even from dispensary to dispensary.  I just went around and bought grams at like 5 different dispensaries until i found one batch I liked, stuck with them, and my loyalty has been rewarded in consistently deliciously delightful Sour Diesel with no end in sight.","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"spacejunkOG","stars":"4","date":"12/8/2014 2:29 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Happy","Relaxed","Uplifted"],"ID":"258913"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-dream","user":"RoggerRabbit","stars":"0","date":"12/6/2014 10:06 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Happy","Uplifted","Sweet"],"ID":"258922"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Just got back from the shop, and all I can smell is LEMON!

In recent years this previously \"clone-only\" strain was purchased by Greenhouse Seeds, and provided in seed form on the open market globally.  Many people argue that the \"real\" strain, which supposedly originated in Arcata, California, is not what you get when you buy it from a seed company, and is *only* available in clone form via trusted growers' networks.  The seed company claims to have simply inbred the clone, to provide an exact replica of the original strain.  The flowering time on trainwreck is also hugely debated and even more shrouded in mystery - which adds to some very different batches of trainwreck - harvested on the late side, you can very easily be stuck on the couch with this stuff.  harvested on the early side with the right environmental factors you could be writing a Physio paper.  Regardless of which phenotype you get, I have never encountered or grown a version of Trainwreck that didn't have the distinctive SPICY, overpowering smell which to me is indicative of the South / Central American genetics that are prevalent in the strain and which I believe lend to its tall, lanky, very sativa-like leaf / branch structure (the flowers, on the other hand, tend to be ubiquitous clusters of relatively small popcorn buds, which are usually highly resinous and sparkling with glass-shard-sized trichomes by mid-flower).  This is also a GREAT medical strain.  Those with general anxiety and eye pressure or eye fatigue should feel amazing relief of ocular pressure and a sense of muscular relaxation without sedation.","strain":"trainwreck","user":"spacejunkOG","stars":"5","date":"12/8/2014 2:45 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Happy","Relaxed","Uplifted"],"ID":"259007"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"purple-wreck","user":"akoss","stars":"5","date":"12/8/2014 4:34 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Berry","Grape","Tree Fruit"],"ID":"259008"},{"_type":"dict","content":"anxiety and sleep. jedi kush is relaxing and sedative.","strain":"jedi-kush","user":"geezusherbs","stars":"4","date":"12/8/2014 7:20 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Relaxed","Sleepy","Earthy"],"ID":"259009"},{"_type":"dict","content":"asdasd","strain":"blue-dream","user":"nick47","stars":"3","date":"12/8/2014 7:24 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"259010"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"rockstar-master-kush","user":"xkurex","stars":"0.5","date":"12/7/2014 1:13 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Happy","Talkative","Energetic"],"ID":"259018"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"purple-kush","user":"myrandafay","stars":"5","date":"12/7/2014 1:16 AM","attributes":["Concentrate ","Energetic","Giggly","Happy","Focused","Relaxed"],"ID":"259019"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"pineapple-express","user":"LCL","stars":"4","date":"12/7/2014 4:47 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Pineapple","Mango"],"ID":"259020"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"vanilla-kush","user":"Monomono","stars":"5","date":"12/7/2014 5:11 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Aroused","Tingly","Uplifted"],"ID":"259021"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"kryptonite","user":"Mgk2501rp","stars":"5","date":"12/7/2014 5:48 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"259022"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"tangerine-dream","user":"Mgk2501rp","stars":"4","date":"12/7/2014 5:51 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"259023"},{"_type":"dict","content":"A classic that alot of of growers are still using as aabench mark for good herb.

Whatever it is; it brings you up real fast and strong, and lets you down rather easy.  The high is more functional (like cleaning the house type of functional), I didn't find it particularly stimulating for creativity, it did relax me while still keeping me highly functional, and I noticed a distinct desire to be more social and talkative.  I continue to buy it and keep it in the medicine cabinet indefinitely, because it's just that classic sativa when you need a surefire sativa.

To say I have trouble falling asleep is putting it mildly. On top of that, once I DO fall asleep, I usually wake up a couple hours later and can't get BACK to sleep making consistent, quality sleep very rare. And I refuse to take sleeping pills.

Typically edibles are suppose to feel like indica, but this one was definitely like a sativa. Initial effect was like being drunk with plenty of energy, then very drunk - hard to walk. Finally it turned into very energized, excited, and lots of dancing. Good high for going out clubbing. Was very aroused. Started to taper off 5 hours after initial consumption. Felt more relaxed as it tapered off. Had a dull headache for most of it, not sure if it was caused by the drug or not.","strain":"purple-trainwreck","user":"moxendale","stars":"4","date":"12/8/2014 8:38 PM","attributes":["Edible ","Aroused","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Talkative","Headache","Relaxed"],"ID":"259695"},{"_type":"dict","content":"It gave me a great feeling head to toe, a long lasting light on your feet high.

I love the smell and flavour of this strain. It is sweet honey, floral, and fruity in taste and smell. Within minutes I feel relaxation in my face and head which slowly creeps into my body to provide pain relief.  The head high is pretty powerful and great for anxiety and stress relief. I don't feel tired but I don't feel like this is giving me energy or wakefulness. I think I can easily be couch locked with this stuff but I could also go out and be social. The sensation is euphoric and relaxing. While I can focus and get some work done at the moment, I think if I vape any more it would be too distracting to focus. I would definitely suggest this strain for late afternoon/early evening use.

It felt like my mind was trying to catch up, I didn't remember exhaling as I became entranced by the experience.  I remember a distinctive butter tasting coating inside my mouth that overpowered my first sip of Mountain Dew.  The buttery phenotypes smoke was heavy yet none irritating.  The migraine I had prior to medicating was extremely strong pulsating rapidly.  1 min after the hit it joined the auditory slowness I was experiencing and the pulsating slowed drastically and so did my pain level.  my ears and fingertips numbed out and a surge of warmth overcame me 5 minutes in.  I became sweaty, content and relaxed.  Despite the strong experience and a slightly increased heart rate 30 minutes later, there was no paranoia the event seemed comical.  The other pheno was potent but didn't have the immediate jaw dropping bitch slap effect.  It had a fruity smell with a rose palate.  During veg the fruity pheno smelled identical to a rose when bumped, during flower it smelt of stripper g strings and blueberry muffins.

I was already a huge fan of vape pens, this just confirmed how consistently awesome they are!  This strain is definitely eliciting the couchlock effect on me, about all I'm good for at the moment is listening to music and writing weed reviews. Although I'm kinda bummed I'm not getting the whole \"whoa dude, I feel like I'm listening to music for the first time!\" Whatever I smoked in the blunt during the pre-show tailgating at the NIN show last year definitely delivered though. The best positive for me is that I don't feel intensely introspective and can just kick back and relax. \n\nNow, for those who select strains based on anxiety or paranoia concerns I'd say it's low to non-existent. I'm a super low frequency smoker and a chemotype fanatic so I get where your coming from. If you take some bioperine and make sure you smoke something with a high testing beta carophyllene and d-limonene content you're golden!\n\nPersonally, the whole purpose my last trip to the dispensary was to find a strain that I could intensely enjoy Battle of the Five Armies with. So far things are really settling into a nice easygoing head/body split, little dizzy after the initial \"sativa\" buzz wore off but decent. Now I just feel drowsy and ready to crash. Final verdict,  don't think this is my choice for Five Armies.\n\nConsidering the heritage of this plant I assumed the Sativas would be the dominant chemotypes and this would be a fairly energetic high. But, it is a welcome surprise that this is a sleepy time weed considering I got my swole on just a little while ago and still feel kinda amped.  \n\n","strain":"blue-dream","user":"yamabushi","stars":"3","date":"12/11/2014 8:01 AM","attributes":["Edible ","Relaxed","Sleepy","Uplifted"],"ID":"261724"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"trainwreck","user":"Cazann","stars":"4","date":"12/11/2014 9:07 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Sweet"],"ID":"261725"},{"_type":"dict","content":"After a stressful week of finals, I picked up some new bud, some GDP.

It was very different from Rene Mist and Jack Herer, and I much preferred it. The negatives aren't as bad, and the high is much more enjoyable for me.\n\nIt took awhile to actually get my order. I had to wait 'til after the weekend for it to be shipped, then the carrier messed up and delayed it another day. The packaging was a bit excessive, and came with another free grinding mat. \n\nDespite the extra packaging, when I opened the bag, I found all the buds squished together into a single big blob. A couple stems were maybe a bit longer than need-be, and there were a few tiny pieces of leaves floating around. The buds feel dry in my hands when I'm breaking them up, but are actually quite sticky, given the way they gum up my grinder and vaporizer.\n\nThe smoke when I vape this is a sickly sweetness I am not fond of. The only other thing I don't like about Barbara Bud is its potency, which is quite low. I have to take a fair bit at a time to get the most pain relief, and that makes it hard to stretch my 0.5g through the whole day. With Rene Mist and Jack Herer, I couldn't manage 0.5g a day because they were too potent.\n\nThe high from this indica is pretty pleasant. Still dry eyes, dry mouth, and dizziness, but none as badly as with the JH and RM. Instead of making me jittery, BB relaxes me and makes me feel really mellow. It doesn't help with my nausea, but at least it doesn't make it worse, like the sativa high did. I still get tingly, and feel uplifted. I don't feel sleepy or glued to the couch, but maybe a bit sluggish. Also, most of my senses are dulled.\n\nI get maybe 15% direct pain relief at the amounts I'm taking. However, I am also better able to handle my pain, because of the mellow, uplifted state generated.\n\nThe effect on my focus is quite interesting. I can focus in on something until I'm almost absorbed by it. Since I usually have trouble focusing on things, I was happy to discover this effect. However, it makes multi-tasking nearly impossible. If I'm having a conversation with someone, for example, I can't do anything else at the same time, or I might zoom in on that and lose track of what's being said. A nice complement to the focus is a boost in creativity, or at least motivation to do something creative. Between the pain relief, the focus, and the creativity, I can happily spend most of the day working on some project, so long as I keep the high going.\n\nWhile this is the best pain relief I've had yet from weed, it still isn't as significant relief as morphine or percocet. However, those put me straight to sleep, and have long-term effects I don't care for, so I prefer the Barbara Bud.","strain":"barbara-bud","user":"Aladrieth","stars":"4","date":"12/11/2014 12:12 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Creative","Focused","Relaxed","Uplifted","Tingly","Dizzy","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth","Sweet"],"ID":"261770"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"green-crack","user":"julia420","stars":"4","date":"12/11/2014 12:16 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Giggly","Happy","Tingly"],"ID":"261771"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"jack-flash","user":"Mchris","stars":"4","date":"12/11/2014 12:17 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Energetic","Relaxed"],"ID":"261772"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Sets in very quickly.

I feel a million times better today than if I'd drunk last night. I don't feel a need to do it again any time soon but knowing it's there keeps my mind at peace.

Buds weren't all stuck together in the bag, though. Ordered because it's a cross between two I'd like to try, but which haven't been available. Expecting an indica high, similar to Barbara Bud.\n\nTook a few hits on low heat, only four hours after 1/4c (~0.12g) of Barbara Bud milk. After a few minutes, my face is tingly and my arms are heavy. The tingling spreads downward, and I start to feel dizzy. Getting more relaxed. Eyes and lips getting dryer. \n\nIs my nausea a bit worse, all of a sudden? I'm not sure, but I did eat less than an hour ago. Pain is noticeably reduced. Fairly drowsy, but that may have already been the case, I don't remember anymore. Feel some version of happy/uplifted, I think the former. Also, hungry. Whole mouth dry, now.\n\nTried more a few hours later. Definitely happy, also giggly while FB chatting with a friend, and experiencing reduced typing capabilities. Not thinking 100% clearly or at full speed, either.\n\nFinished the 0.25g around 22:15 or 22:30. Think I felt nausea again. Over three hours later, still feeling quite buzzed in the head. Dizzy, dazed, drained, sore eyes - rather like the blitzed state at the end of an NSci semester; it's difficult for me to remember things, too. Not sure, but I think the analgesic effect has partly faded. Ate an orange to hopefully reduce the buzzing before bed.\n\nStill felt somewhat blitzed when I went to bed at 3:00. However, may be relevant to note that I felt foggy, tired, and nauseated when I got up the next day, without getting high.","strain":"haoma-mist","user":"Aladrieth","stars":"3","date":"12/14/2014 1:13 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Relaxed","Tingly","Happy","Hungry","Giggly","Dizzy","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth","Flowery","Mint"],"ID":"263076"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Fantastic cross","strain":"sour-grapes","user":"lemonmerrengue","stars":"5","date":"12/14/2014 1:44 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"263077"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Initially really liked it a lot - good energy - but let down was hard and got a headache everytime.

Let's me tell you. Blue Dream is simply orgasmic. I could barely keep my eyes open. The taste is very \"berry-ish\"? I have bipolar disorder(genetically, it runs in my family). \n\nI always have millions of thoughts and feelings that can become quite over powering at times.  Blue Dream calmed those thoughts and feelings. It felt as if I was completely connected to nature(since I was outside during the summer around late afternoon when I first tried it). \n\nIt feels as if some strange ethereal force began to melt over me. I felt like I was floating, my body felt light. I'm not sure why the most helpful review suggested that Blue Dream isn't recommended for Bipolar or Schizophrenia(my uncle has it, and it's calmed him down as well) conditions. I'm sure they did not research these conditions to make that sort of prognosis. :\\ \n\nBut, I digress. If you have personality disorders like me, this strain is perfect for you. If you experience constant up and down feelings/thoughts, this will level you out. You will feel \"normal\", but everything will feel surreal, dreamy, shadowy, utopian,lulling,arousing/horny and otherworldly at the same time. I felt so tingly, as if some of the nerves in my body had ascended to heaven. I kid you not! I actually got an orgasm from this strain, with NO physical stimulus. But I'm not a seasoned smoker, so I'm quite sensitive/low tolerance to marijuana. \n\nThey may as well call this \"Blue Dream Orgasm\" for me ;).  It was very magical/wild experience for me.

A glass mason jar or some other sealing container should do the trick.  Its scent is distinctive; skunky, piney, kinda like taking a hike in the woods.  There are many strains with a similar scent, due to OG's expansive list of children, but none of them smell /quite/ like the original OG Kush.\n\nAs for the taste, it's actually surprisingly fruity and berry-flavored, especially on longer draws.  One of my favorite-tasting buds.  But it's also one of the most potent strains I've ever had.  No sacrifice between flavor and potency.  Smoke is really smooth as long as you don't take long draws.  It'll still be smooth if you do, but it can overwhelm even an experienced stoner with fits of coughing.  OG Kush hits like a pro boxer, and it'll knock you down if you don't keep your guard up.  This stuff sits on a shelf above the top shelf.\n\nAs for effects, it's a hybrid, so you get the head and the body highs, ya'll should know about that stuff.  I wouldn't say this strain has any unique uses in treating ailments, but it's so potent that it does it all pretty damn well.  I use it for anxiety and migraines mostly.  Also good for nausea.  You'll be energized, for sure.  Not a ton of couch lock, so long as you plan out something to do before lighting up.  I feel quite creative high on this bud, but have some problems staying focused.  No other negative symptoms.\n\nJust smoked a bowl of it bout two hours ago.  Still reasonably high, but definitely coming down.  No harsh falls, either.  Has about an average length of effect.  You can use less of this stuff than you typically use for other strains and acquire a similar high.  Saves you a few bucks on weed cost, which might make up for the higher price this bud typically commands.\n\nSmoke more, chill out.  Peace.","strain":"og-kush","user":"LazyDreamer","stars":"5","date":"12/14/2014 5:30 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Talkative","Sweet","Berry","Earthy","Pungent","Skunk","Woody","Pine","Blueberry","Grape"],"ID":"263230"},{"_type":"dict","content":"The first strain I bought from Canna Clinic and it is amazing!!!

This initial flavor lasted for the first 4 – 5 draws then mellowed out.  \n\nAt this point I could feel the onset of the effects; a calming, warm bodied mellowness, ease of anxiety and a feeling of calm.  A fast onset with zero rush.  This right here is a new favorite!!\n\nI clicked the Solo up and continued.  Beautiful vapor clouds and enhanced effects.  I clicked off before needing to go to level 6 and 7.\n\nBTW - This product was from Tweed, my licensed producer in the Canadian MMPR program!","strain":"uk-cheese","user":"kushbury","stars":"4.5","date":"12/13/2014 11:53 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Relaxed","Uplifted","Earthy","Blue Cheese"],"ID":"263284"},{"_type":"dict","content":"My absolute favorite!","strain":"hippie-crippler","user":"inessrose","stars":"5","date":"12/13/2014 11:17 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Talkative","Uplifted","Tingly","Hungry","Giggly","Happy","Relaxed","Dry Mouth","Earthy","Sweet","Pungent"],"ID":"263283"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Heady, slow pulse, a little buzz in the arms/hands.

I read the reviews on this strain that is carried by a collective in SC by Santa Cruz Mountain Naturals. I was VERY impressed by the knowledge of the bud tender ( I can't remember his name) and I can see why this has received the reviews that it has. It's wonderful. Definitely got me going and energized. I found that it was a good focusing med for the first few hours of use.

But also has it's not so beautiful moments. To start off, frosty fingers aren't to worry about. Although you can clearly see the crystals, they do not stick to your fingers. Compacted pretty tight so you get bang for your buck. Easy to spread. Everything is good until the smoking part. The stats don't lie when they say this strain has an earthy/woody taste to it. It tastes like... I want to say lemon mixed with burnt wood, If you can imagine that. I do not like the taste but thankfully that's the only downside to this strain. Once you get that first big hit off, 2 minutes later you're feeling it. There's no creeping up on you, it comes slowly and stays for not too long, of course depending on how much you smoked. If you want to listen to music and sit back and close your eyes, this weed is just right for you. If you smoked a lot, you'll be taken away to whatever music fits your preference. Now although it is an indica hybrid, it does have a sativa kick at the comedown. You feel like you can really focus on something. That happens like an hour or two after you smoked. Now one thing I'd like to add is that there's no such thing as pain during the coming of the peak and the peak. THAT is also when you start getting most hungry. You will eat and eat and eat until your stomach realizes, \"oh shit I'm literally about to burst.\" So know your limit when it comes to food. I give it a 7/10 because of its ugly taste and hunger. I'm already fat, I do not need to eat anymore, but it happens anyway.

I felt like my brain was speeding up but I had no problem keeping up. I could see this being a great daytime choice. I felt a lot of energy and wanted to dance. Sex was enhanced like it always is for me (I always have the heightened arousal effect) then afterwards my husband and I sat down to watch Pineapple Express and enjoyed it thoroughly. Sometimes when I'm high I misunderstand the actors emotions or facial expressions cause I get too overly focused on things, but with this I was able to follow everything perfectly but had great bouts of giggling randomly throughout the movie (doesn't hurt that it's a perfect movie to watch while high of course). By the end of the night I felt ready for bed and fell asleep feeling really great. A perfect cycle I think. Plenty of energy earlier in the night and a very subtle and smooth ride back down which prepares you for a perfect night of sleep.
