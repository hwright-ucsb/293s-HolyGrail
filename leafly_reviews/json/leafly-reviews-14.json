The smell is amazingly light and sweet, nothing like you would typically associate with the stereotype MJ smell of skunks BO from high school weed back in the day, haha.\n\nI now have found I prefer edibles, cannaoil (made with coconut oil works best for me) but first tried it in a Raw organic cone, and this review is for smoking.  I am by no means a cigarette smoker, but from my very first drag it was smooth, pleasant, and held that fruity sweetness.  If I AM going to smoke, as opposed to eat, it's going to be Blueberry or a close hybrid.\n\nIt took about ten minutes or so to kick in and then I noticed that colors seemed to be enhanced, on top of that I was getting more talkative and feeling cheerfully relaxed until I finally busted out into all out giggles thirty minutes into my smoke.  The giggling was steady for about twenty minutes then tapered on and off for the rest of the hour, though time felt very slow.  I felt energetic, like a girl at a slumber party.  I wanted to bounce on the bed and sing goofy songs to the point  that my husband thought I had lost my mind- then we realized I was BOUNCING ON THE BED!  \n\nI have had two significant spinal surgeries that have left me needing a large amount of narcotics to get by day to day at a slugs pace, and even then I still hurt, feel nauseated, tired, and fatigued in general.  Yet there I was, feeling awesome for the first time in as long as I can remember, with clear, happy thoughts, having a great Friday night with my husband.  At some point in my giggle fit my pain had disappeared to the point that I was able to turn off my electronic stimulated that I have implanted, and was still pain free and energized without being hyper.  I had no trouble falling asleep when it was time.\n\nI was relaxed, inspired, happy, and pain free is an understatement.  The high lasted about 4 hours, but the body effects and pain relief lasted all through the night.  I awoke with relaxed muscles, my joints were not inflamed, and after turning my stimulator back on one of its lowest settings, I was able to go the whole day into the next morning without any oral pain relievers or muscle relaxers (i do have a patch I wear 24h a day to slow release into my system and I felt so good, I forgot to change it; it lasted a day longer than it normally did).  \n\nWhen smoked a drag or two at a time,  broken throughout the day, as opposed to a whole joint at once, I can minimize the giggles and extend the pain relief without interfering with my day to day at all.  \n\nNo dry mouth, dry eyes, or crazed hunger for me\n","strain":"dj-short-blueberry","user":"insightfulnothings","stars":"5","date":"3/22/2015 8:50 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Energetic","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Uplifted","Relaxed","Focused","Creative","Aroused"],"ID":"335182"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"fruity-pebbles","user":"Anal19Abomination89","stars":"5","date":"3/22/2015 9:17 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"335183"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"lemon-drop","user":"KKblower","stars":"5","date":"3/22/2015 10:52 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"335184"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"northern-lights","user":"zigzagzig420","stars":"4","date":"3/22/2015 12:10 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Happy"],"ID":"335185"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Greened in public on this stuff. 5/5","strain":"northern-lights","user":"Gummi","stars":"5","date":"3/22/2015 1:15 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"335186"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Sweet citrus flavor which makes this sativa a favorite of mine.

Used their onsite volcano to vaporize a small chunk.  Fruity tasting, sweet aroma that reminds me of sipping a sour ale a little bit.  Energetic high.  Sustained me on an hours-long, crosstown bicycle ride from one side of the city to the other, with lots of hills, on an empty stomach no less.  A little bit of dizziness though.  Definitely a workout enhancer.  Need to try it out on a 3-5 mile run.  Not a conversation blocker, but will get you sort of babbling a bit.  Impedes reading a little, but doesn't seem to get in the way of writing quite as much.  This stuff definitely gives you the urge to be active and physical over sedate and cerebral.

The smoke is quite expansive, and will most likely take you by surprise, even if you are a \"seasoned\" smoker.

Can almost immediately feel your ears getting hot, and head tingle, while enjoy enjoying a mellow warm \"melting\" slowly fall from head to toe.

I smoked two bowls one morning and 3 hours later I was still feeling the body high really well but my head was pretty clear.

In terms of the buzz, it's good and it's not overpowering which makes it a good daytime weed for heavy smokers.  If it were left to effects alone, I'd probably just give what I had a 3.  Nice, relaxing, mellow, take the edge off with a very slight heaviness on the eyelids.  And, I was still very functional while smoking this strain.  HOWEVER, while I am one that finds the high just okay, the appearance, the smell and the taste of this stuff on the other hand, is WAY BEYOND 5 stars.  I want to smoke it just for the smell and flavor alone!  It's da kine that when you smell it, your body starts telling you that it really wants it.  Amazing and freakin' yum-EEE !!!

The flavor was worse than the smell; wretched and rotten seem an apt description, but nowhere along the lines of rotten fruit or fuel.  The high was no stronger or better a start to the day than any other Sativa of the same potency, and the flavor and aroma detracted from the overall experience immeasurably.

Unless you yourself have smoked any of these strains and they were grown and cured properly, you probably don't know what the African continent has to offer the cannabis world.  These are some of the most uplifting, energetic, clear-headed and actually *medicinal* strains in the world, and many of them are still in their pure un-hybridized form (it's very hard to find pure unadulterated landraces anymore).  African landrace strains are said to contain the highest THCV-a content of any other place in the world - this cannabinoid contributes to a more energetic buzz and is an appetite *suppressant*, not an appetite stimulant like THC.  It is being researched as a treatment for Parkinsons and other diseases.  It is one of the promising cannabinoids like CBD which could have many uses in the medical community.  And it is found most commonly in African landrace strains.  \n\nSo, to get a bit of the African experience, first go try some real Durban (half the \"Durban Poison\" I find in dispensaries is some complete different strain) - it should smell like mint spices and jasmine (some people say licorice) the smell is what gives away real Durban; if it smells kind of Skunky, it's from one of the many seedbanks who cross their Durban with Skunk #1 to shorten flowering time, and is NOT pure Durban.  Then get your hands on some Malawi, and maybe some Congolese or Swazi Gold, because in the USA that's about all that circulates for the public, and even that is not easy to find. Or track down these seed lines and grow them yourself - there are a couple seed companies that still have these strains although they can be hard to obtain.","strain":"african","user":"spacejunkOG","stars":"5","date":"3/26/2015 9:50 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"337456"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Pleasant taste as well as a pungent odor.

I had a discussion with the bud tender about it being a Sativa as it was labeled Hybrid. It definitely hits like a hybrid, and I happen to be a huge fan of the Hybrid stone/high effects, and Indica stoned effects. This particular grow is awesome! I can't wait to actually get some Sativa Dp though. She deserves her ââââ. The one thing that always keeps me from giving âââââ is how hard hitting the stone or high is and how it effects me. I feel the high in my head, and life seems brighter. However,  I only took 3 hits of the pipe and I don't want to get ready for work. That's why I decided to review the bud. So as you can see, if you happen to come across Dp that is labled Hybrid, ask about the effect because this Sativa miht not be for you. I like it. This one is a well deserved ââââ.

Takes to training very well, adding Sillica to the feeding program allows a grower to give some plyability to the branching to make them more sturdy during scroging or training. High Yeilder, almost 8-10 oz per plant. If nothing else was said about Chemdawg it's a producer. Let it cure. The better the cure on Chemdawg, the more kick-ass stone a person gets. It is off the chart, fist a spacy time warp wash covers your minds eye. A surreal feeling as time and space seem to come to an almost halt. Video gamers and Dungeons and Dragons players will love Chemdawg. Second wave body numbness, after the space trip it takes you electric avenue where you feel great. Aches and pains, the little nagging pains that we come acustomed to go away. Arthritis.. low back,, bad-day, whatever. It does impair quick decision making ability, peeps gonna know your high as fuck. Visine and cologne if you wanna brave the job. One observation on how Chemdawg effects femails is of important note. It's been heralded as the \"Game Changer\" every man who has ever tried to land a femail has been given a mighty sword to strike back with..You guessed it, Chemdawg. Women and Chemdawg.

It was a 45 minute walk home (we were mainly walking through quiet wedge-land), and I went from going completely numb to going into a massive pain and fatigue. When we were walking through the wedge, it was dark and the only source of light was a torch on my friends phone; this is where I started to have the psychedelic experience. I started to see shadows ahead of me portraying life through the 19th Century. I started to see shadows of ghosts and people kneeling down near the trees doing work, and horse carriages coming past me - it was both terrifying, but also intriguing.

However, when you smoke too much, it because quite overbearing. I had a party at a friends house last night, and had a bunch of hits from this weed through a bong with 4 bottles of Budweiser.\n\nI had an almost psychedelic-like experience. At first when I was smoking it, it felt great; I had an amazing body high, and it felt like there was an orb floating around in my throat whilst the rest of my body was numb. \n\nOnce we we're about to leave, I decided to have a hit from the bong. It was a 45 minute walk home (we were mainly walking through quiet wedge-land), and I went from going completely numb to going into a massive pain and fatigue. When we were walking through the wedge, it was dark and the only source of light was a torch on my friends phone; this is where I started to have the psychedelic experience. I started to see shadows ahead of me portraying life through the 19th Century. I started to see shadows of ghosts and people kneeling down near the trees doing work, and horse carriages coming past me - it was both terrifying, but also intriguing.

The first time I got it, it had notes of musky pepper, melon, and citrus.  This second time, I am getting a very faint and alluring \"orange pinesol\" when I crack into the small, trichome dusted sativa buds.  The traits of Harlequin that I disliked the most (the \"orange-syrupyness\" mainly) are improved on quite a bit in this hybrid.  The taste is very mild, but the smoke is thick; the bowl stays lit if you want it to, yet paces itself between hits, and doesn't burn up before you can return.  The high is a creeper without a doubt, clear and euphoric.  I enjoy it alone as a wake and bake, or in between bowls of potent THC rich sativas.

It hits kinda smoothly and tastes earthy with a slight fruity, grape flavor in my opinion. My only problem with this weed is my problem with most indicas, it's an indica. The intense body high makes it hard to function and get stuff done. If I do try to function after smoking it I'm clumsy, slow, and constantly wishing I was back at home watching tv or something. This weed definitely induces major couchlock, however, it's great for right before bed or when you're just looking for some relaxation. All of my muscles seemed to relax after the high kicked in and I feel calmer than I've felt in days (I've been pretty down these last few days). In addition to the relaxing body high the high also provides enough of a 'stoned' feeling in my head to majorly slow me down, distract me, and lift my spirits a little bit. I'm tired and I have no doubt this weed will help me sleep well for a few hours. Overall the high is pretty good for an indica, but for me, indicas are really only good for so much.

The flavor of this bud is quite spicy with a slight hint of pine.  Jack Herer is great for morning time use.  \nWhen it comes to growing this plant, there a few things to keep in mind.  If you can, grow it indoors, unless you live near the equator.  Sativa plants usually thrive in warm tropical climates.  The interesting thing about phenotypes with Northern Lights genetics present, is that they tend to help sativa dominant strains grow better outdoors. The Northern Lights genetics not only help the plants resilience in outdoor growing, but also give life to thick dense buds with neon orange hairs.  I recommend growing this plant inside until about week 8. At week 8 flush the plant very well and move it to an outside location.  Be confident! if the plant is true Jack Herer the Northern Lights genetics will help it thrive in outdoor weather and give it a full flavor that you could never get with indoor growing.","strain":"jack-herer","user":"VTgrower9","stars":"4","date":"3/29/2015 12:03 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Happy","Hungry","Talkative","Uplifted","Earthy","Pine","Spicy/Herbal"],"ID":"338459"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Fire","strain":"white-fire-og","user":"paybacc","stars":"5","date":"3/29/2015 12:38 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"338460"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Dry mouth, harsh to smoke, a bit tired but it's relaxing","strain":"strawberry-kush","user":"jbrown034","stars":"4","date":"3/29/2015 12:51 PM","attributes":["Concentrate ","Aroused","Dizzy","Dry Mouth","Happy","Relaxed","Sleepy","Uplifted"],"ID":"338461"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Hard hitting and creative with an energetic head high, may impart a bit of paranoia and anxiety so dependent on a good space","strain":"dutch-treat","user":"mygoggles","stars":"4","date":"3/29/2015 2:36 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Dizzy","Dry Mouth","Energetic","Happy","Talkative","Sweet","Earthy","Woody"],"ID":"338462"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"pineapple-express","user":"MrTreyBaller","stars":"4","date":"3/29/2015 3:10 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"338463"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This has got to be the giggliest, most intense and energetic high I've ever had.

It's a great overall balance between the super paranoia and the ultra euphoria.  4/5 would be a 5 but the woody taste and skunk is just bleh. High Desert here has the best hands down tightest and thick vape n smoke ive seen a bud produce hydroponic LED cannabis is the way to go it looks like its been rolled in sugar there are a lot of thc and cbd there in these buds. The price is perfect and if you just want like a fat nug they can price it out so much easier and better products, not to mention text ordering if your a patient up to date and can hold orders if you go out of town. Wish more dispensaries tried better methods.","strain":"ak-47","user":"Chill_Panda","stars":"4","date":"3/29/2015 6:53 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Euphoric","Focused","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Dry Mouth","Skunk","Woody","Tea","Tar","Diesel","Spicy/Herbal","Sage"],"ID":"338604"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I am in love.

After a movie or some easy reading or gaming, you can easily fall back into more social atmospheres while maintaining a stress-free and euphoric buzz.

This strain still manages to set my dome alight, usually notice a large decrease in high after a few days of smoking the same strain and the same happened for this one but the resulting high is still beautiful. Love the lemon skunk crosses. Energetic, euphoric, clear headed, and honestly lemon skunk strains just set the dome alight, you have such a will and motivation to live your life to the fullest. Recommend trying amnesia lemon from barneys, super lemon haze from greenhouse. Those two strains along with this one are my all time favourite, they never fail to disappoint. Asher, on your comment I noticed you said you felt tired after the euphoric high? I'm fairly certain you have an organic grow, I've noticed with organic grown lemon haze after that initial euphoria the body high becomes huge unlike hydroponic grows that do not produce a body high (very slight, typical sativa) and the head high is much clearer and I may say stronger but difficult to determine. I do prefer the hydro, but the organic is great for late evenings as it's still functional but much more entertaining due to trying to stay awake haha. Or maybe that's just me as I don't particularly enjoy indicas as much sativas, but the organic grow is top notch. Legalise UK, end this discrimination. Love, peace and happiness. It can be possible in this world, we just need the will of the people to change it.

Some people by nature rebel against them. But whether by genetics or upbringing or whatever, I find that things go better when I pay a lot of attention to rules.\n\nThis is prominently true for games and sports. If Iï¿½ï¿½m going to spend a lot of time playing a game, Iï¿½ï¿½m going to learn its rules like a lawyer studying for the bar exam, <a href=\"http://www.rikipoker.com\">texas holdem</a>  and then use my knowledge of them to gain a tactical edge, and to be sure that Iï¿½ï¿½m not taken advantage of because of lack of familiarity with the rules.\n\nBut my fondness for rules also extends to non-game situations. Over my several decades on planet Earth, I have accumulated a set of rules for life. Some of these were taught to me by my parents, some by other people, and some I have worked out for myself ï¿½ï¿½ often by suffering the consequences of breaking them.\n\n\n\nThere are many more, but you get the idea. I wonï¿½ï¿½t claim that I always and perfectly adhere to my own rules, but I can attest that life goes by more smoothly and easily when I do.\n\nAs with life in general, I have found that poker goes better for me when I follow a comparable set of rules ï¿½ï¿½ not the rules of the game, but for how I approach it.\n\nImportantly, these do not pertain to specific tactics. I have no rules that say things like, ï¿½ï¿½Never open for a raise from early position with a junk hand.ï¿½ï¿½ Thatï¿½ï¿½s because poker is so heavily situation-dependent that there is some time, place, and circumstance for nearly every move that would be insane to use as a general practice.","strain":"efa8320e-ac15-46b1-95da-e61e049118e9","user":"hexinli","stars":"5","date":"4/1/2015 10:02 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Dry Mouth","Headache"],"ID":"339754"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Really nice, smooth, even high.

One of the best available locally (Spain- South). Have had great experiences with this weed. I'm going to write a comprehensive review so i'll give you the \"TL;DR\" version here: The flavour is lemony/citrus/tingly and the high comes on slow, but after 20 minutes it certainly gives the user uplifting euphoric feelings and usually lasts about 2 hours. \nRight, to get into the review.\nMe and my friend were both hooking up with dealers locally long before we were friends, mostly smoking hash and weed on special occasions like parties and camping trips. Going back a few weeks, he had hooked up with a dealer the other side of the boarder (Spain) and came back with great, home grown (non- hydroponic) weed, which, according to him was one of the best he'd smoked. I had to sample this. \nSo we go for a drive, and i roll a cone of weed, with a little tobacco (recommended by him as this weed didn't burn well alone). I take the first hit, and the effect is not much like what i'm used to smoking, the immediate effect isn't strong, but the taste is. The lemon is immediately obvious, and the deep kush-like high came on about 20 minutes after. Upon taking a toke, taste the smoke. The lemon flavor dances on your tongue. The high is a full-body uplifting high, and lasts a decent amount of time. \nWould recommend it to anybody that wants the aforementioned effects. Would not recommend to amateurs; too strong.","strain":"lemon-kush","user":"420-1996","stars":"4","date":"4/2/2015 1:23 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Uplifted","Sweet","Berry","Citrus","Lime","Lemon"],"ID":"340686"},{"_type":"dict","content":"great strain","strain":"platinum-girl-scout-cookies","user":"likehova","stars":"4","date":"4/2/2015 2:01 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"340687"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I would take your time with headband and smoke it in breaks, headband is said to have a high effect that feels like you've been wearing a headband.

And in this calm you become more aware, allowing you look at every aspect of any situation you can think of, thus making you a more focused logical thinker.... \nIn other words this stuff is the shit \uD83D\uDC4D","strain":"blackberry-kush","user":"Tom2713","stars":"5","date":"4/3/2015 11:50 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy","Relaxed","Hungry","Sleepy","Focused","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth","Uplifted"],"ID":"341494"},{"_type":"dict","content":"this is a top shelf indica for me. comes on hard and stays alive. good pain eliminator, even better for stress abd anxiety","strain":"bubba-kush","user":"skinnyhb","stars":"5","date":"4/3/2015 12:48 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Euphoric","Happy","Relaxed","Sleepy","Uplifted","Earthy","Pungent","Skunk"],"ID":"341495"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I love this strain.

There is nothing else that really needs to be said, it just is.  From start to finish, it continues to be to be one of my most intense highs from flower. My first experience with it was going over to a friend's house to hear \"dude, you gotta try this stuff, it'll knock you flat.\" Naturally, I was very skeptical at first, as a seasoned smoker, it had been a long time since I'd been really really high off of flower alone, and my assumption was that this would be no different. I was more than pleasantly surprised when I found out that I could not be more wrong. Three rips from his favorite bong later, and I'm absolutely soaring through space at a million miles an hour, laughing and feeling incredibly head high, and it was one hell of a rush at that. I was absolutely full of energy and incredibly happy, feeling more relaxed than any time I could previously recall. The high also brought back my favorite yet elusive effect of an insatiable love for music, causing a mild but definitely noticeable synesthesia, inducing what can only be described as a full-body orgasm of sound. All in all, the effects lasted, and for the most part continue to last, almost three hours, with a nice body high slowly developing overtime with aftereffects lasting long into the late afternoon. I highly recommend this strain, if you can get your hands on this, you absolutely will not regret it, and even you veterans out there are in for a hell of a treat!","strain":"cinex","user":"jonnymad","stars":"5","date":"4/3/2015 4:15 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Energetic","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Relaxed","Talkative","Tingly","Uplifted","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth","Citrus","Honey","Earthy","Pungent"],"ID":"341497"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Smells dank.

If you are looking for a more energetic high, get a sativa.\n\nIt's not bad by all means but, in my opinion, it's a strain you have to smoke not fast but moderate (no long wait times for the next bowl). If you are in a group (3-5 people) that is talking while smoking, prepare for a good 2-3 bowls to get you good.\n\nPrepare to snack. The hunger isn't bad, but it's good for a couple double cheeseburgers from Micky D's (McDonalds).\n\nMe, my boyfriend and his brother all smoked about 3 bowls. They took harder hits and fell asleep later on so fare warning.\n\nThe high does come quick, but it differs from how it's smoked. Best to do if you have a small group is do bong rips or joints. \n\nCONCLUSION: Nice strain if alone or with small groups. You will be relaxed and a little hungry \n\nSide note:This strain isn't worth paying $20 a g for, maybe $13 or $15.","strain":"purple-kush","user":"IamEdward","stars":"4","date":"4/5/2015 8:30 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Sleepy","Happy","Creative","Relaxed","Aroused"],"ID":"342382"},{"_type":"dict","content":"     When it comes to an indica-dominant or even pure strain, this one right here has my heart.

There's a light dusting of crystals and some orange hairs, but it's not much to look at on the whole. \n\nVery pungent flowers.  The diesel smell hits you right away upon opening the jar, followed soon after by some citrus notes, some skunk and chemical notes can be sniffed out after, and I also keep getting a slight hint of that nice OG kush scent.  Unfortunately the smell was probably the highlight of this strain for me.  \n\nThere's no testing info on the label, but it's clear after one bowl that it's a very potent batch.  It smokes pretty nicely (buds are a tiny bit on the dry side) and has a nice flavor.  The high takes a good 10 minutes or so to really reach it's peak but as I said when it does it's very potent.  \n\nThis strain is a very good value at 110 per half, and it's obviously quality bud, but just too much like an indica for my personal taste.","strain":"707-headband","user":"adk1978","stars":"3","date":"4/6/2015 5:02 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Citrus","Lemon","Pungent","Chemical","Diesel"],"ID":"342517"},{"_type":"dict","content":"It only takes a few bong rips of this stuff to get you really high.

I mean what I purchased was labeled \"Purple Jones\"  & I was thinking that it was going to have a berry/fruity flavor to it.  It smells flowery & herbal, not really fruity, but thats what I associate with the purple strains (fruity flavor).\n\nAs for the medicine itself, it's mellow.  Not really too strong, not really too week, hence the 3 star rating.  It's a good 3 stars, but it just doesn't have that 4 or 5 star kick to it.  I like the hybridity of it, that it has that sativa mind effect coupled with the body effect of the indica.  It did do that for me & that's what I was looking for at that particular moment in time.\n\nFor the record I didn't feel paranoid or anxious when this medicine was working on me.  I read through the comments & saw folks had a problem with that.   It did relieve my pain symptoms, but not really something I would smoke before bed.

The relaxing side of this strain is only motivated by what you want to do if you need energy you're on the move if you wanna chill sink into your mind's couch. I was hesitant to try this strain simply because it has the same things as shiskaberry which is a strain that just doesn't agree with me at all.

I saw one of it's parent strains are strawberry cough and I have asthma so I was like \"shit..\" But it was quite smooth and had a good smoking quality versus vape. Just like the strawberry cough the sativa effects weren't instantaneous, so smoking more and more I started to feel it, then the only way to compare it to was first was a consistent dribble to feeling like a blast from the fire hose.

Describe this very cerebral very drastic change is that it makes things brighter shinier and it will make you happy euphoric and ecstatic. I have a very high tolerance user and I would say Panama lasts for about three hours. I can see why they call it panama red it smells of Cherry and tea leaves and the hairs around it form and small clumps around the greeny leafy product. I would say that the smell and taste are very different the buds smell of cherries and Tea along with super lemon lime citrus tones.  It's pungent and T like taste and give it in the classic cannabis skunk in diesel feel. I would say the dry eyes come on first because you start to notice that the lights linger in your vision for a little bit and the smoke is so thick that it still sticks around after 10-15 seconds. Happy euphoric and the energetics signed it comes from Panama the red side would have to be a very different phenotype is introduced to the strain. After all I wonder if Panama red is actually just Panama crossed with red. Are are famous trains like the red diesel is supposed to be an Indica I've had vintage diesel and I would say the panama red is of the same heritage if not the parents of red diesel and vintage diesel. Overall great smoke if you have a high tolerance and are looking for something energetic and cheerful I highly recommend the strain get as much as you can often because it doesn't come around like ever!

I have been to coffee shops in the dam recently and seen contaminated products for sale to tourists who don't know enough to tell the difference. It's done in order to increase profits/weight. I also suspect that they remove the thc from the plants whilst flowering to use for isolator hash and then spray it with a mixture of chemicals including haze spray and Brixx. Just a friendly warning to fellow UK and EU smokers - do not buy this strain unless you know the grower personally or at least know how to tell if it's sprayed it not.

You get creative, you get open-minded, and you just have a good time.  Unfortunately, there are some negatives to it. While it does not make you very hungry, it does give you a dry mouth. While that may be a problem, it still doesn't ruin the rest of the high; you still have an open mind to talk about things that have been on your mind, about new ideas,etc. Not to mention it has a very good smell to it. It's not a smell that is very attractive per se, but it has a strong, potent, skunky smell to it. That itself gives the strain two thumbs up. If it stank, its some good dank.  Over and above all, I close with this, purple cheese is not for beginners. It is for people who are seeking a high like never before! However, it's not the only strain that gives you this kind of high, but the strain delivers it really well, while looking beautiful. With its luscious orange hairs, it's pearlescent white crystals, and it's leafy green bud; all of it adds to the awesomeness.\n","strain":"purple-cheese","user":"dirtybongwater","stars":"5","date":"4/10/2015 12:28 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Dizzy","Dry Mouth","Energetic","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Relaxed","Talkative","Tingly","Uplifted","Cheese","Earthy","Pungent","Skunk"],"ID":"344338"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This is the best weed I've ever smoked !

Â¼ gram \n\nReview:  Iâm not usually one to start the session in the mid afternoon with a OG must less one like Kenâs OG.  But the pain level today was high, I had nothing really going on so I decided WTF and went for it.   Holy smokes itâs a true creeper.  I was able to get three full pulls off one scoop.  The taste is piney and woodsy and super clean.  I had just poured a quad espresso down my throat and the flavor cut right through that.  Iâm finding it difficult to remember things from seconds ago and really just want to put this computer down and chill.  I will resist that temptation for the time being and say that this grow is nice.  Not exceptional but nice.  Fluffy looking but only midly yielding to the squeeze the buds hold together well, and a nicely structured.  There are a fair amount of red hairs and a lighter frosting of crystals.  Still this is a powerhouse bud.  Almost all body heavy buzz with a light headed feel.  The cure and trim is beautiful as one would expect from this quality of bud.  For the price I paid for the OZ. I am reasonably satisfied.  Itâs no Jetfuel or Godfather but it will hold its own, especially with less seasoned patients.","strain":"9340b731-dc93-4c27-9ded-8370c8658a63","user":"chefstew1969","stars":"5","date":"4/13/2015 10:06 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Relaxed","Sleepy","Woody","Pine"],"ID":"345713"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"durban-poison","user":"wavybynature","stars":"3","date":"4/13/2015 10:49 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"345714"},{"_type":"dict","content":"One of my favorites, good flavor and fantastiv sativa high","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"DrRobotDIKK","stars":"5","date":"4/13/2015 11:43 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"345715"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Great upper.

My standard scoop is about 1/5 to 1/4 gram.  i was able to get 4 full pulls from this flower.  When ground the scent was very similar to Chernobly (Golden Ticket) cut.  There was a hint of lemon pledge as well.  The trim was not as nice as I would like to see on a top shelf flower, but is is less of an issue for me since I vape.  The taste was very close to a mix of chemdawg and UK blue cheese.  A little spice, a little funk and a  ton of \"chem\".  The first thing I noticed was the immediate impact to my head.  The instant vapor entered my lung  head change began.  A wave of relaxation and anticipation rolled over me.  The buzz is up in nature and at this point not at ll overwhelming.  I find the effects are calming an focusing.  The shoulder pain that I was experiencing before partaking has either subsided or my brain is just not acknowldeging it, for that I am thankful.  At $290/oz it's a little above what I would like to see, but if the pain relief conintes this afternoon it may just be worth it @ about $2.00 a pop.","strain":"jesus-og","user":"chefstew1969","stars":"4","date":"4/13/2015 9:57 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Euphoric","Focused","Happy","Relaxed","Lemon","Blue Cheese","Chemical","Diesel"],"ID":"345905"},{"_type":"dict","content":"because i am naturally aware and sensitive ... this turned out to be one of the better strains i've had. i got down hard with my pax vap one night and could not turn it off ... layer after layer ... deeper and deeper ... an ongoing and constant ride for at least five (5) hours.

Fluffy looking but only midly yielding to the squeeze the buds hold together well, and a nicely structured.  There are a fair amount of red hairs and a lighter frosting of crystals.

It smells like old furniture and when ground itâs simply nauseating to me.  That aside I went ahead and took a few pulls and a slow calm, gentle wave of happy sort of crept up on me.  The taste was thankfully not similar to the smell, but herbal and woodsy.  I was relaxing on the back patio when then the sounds of the birds, and fountain just all came into focus.  I now see why so many musicians groove on this strain.  Itâs by no means any kind of ass kicking whollop, but more of a gentle mood elevator.  It lasts about an hour and the buzz sort of simply terminates.  I worked on it for a good part of the morning and suffered no ill effects at all.  Price point for me is high @ $290/oz.  Itâs top quality med for sure but in my book it does not register a value for price paid.

This afternoon I chose XJ-13 as my afternoon selection.  I got about two good pulls from the vapor/bong combo.  Vape is light on weight and flavor.  This bud has been sitting around in one of those stupid film cans for about 5 months.  When I first got it, I must have been less than impressed with the product.  \n\nIâve since given it another shot here, and it seems to be doing just what I need, rounding the corners off my day.  This is not as âstonyâ as the Tangerine Dream from earlier in the week and I appreciate it at this point.  20 Minuets in and all is well.  No anxiety, no troublesome thoughts, just the desire to chill and write.  No body effect is to be found what so ever.  Iâm even having an easier time writing this than with the Tangerine.\n\nAs I ground the flowers the resulting lilâ piles sent reminded me that of Chernobylâs unique scent.  The strain is said to be citrus in smell and flavor and I found none of that.  More like fall leaves and an old rag with weeks old varnish on it.  I know I paid in hindsight probably more than I should have.  This is a quality grow but not top-shelf by any stretch.   It looks a very light brown or blond color with a fine coating of white crystals.  The buds are pinecone shaped, small and yield to pressure.  Its not fluffy, itâs not rock hard.\n\nIâd say if someone offered me up an OZ of this for say $120.00 Iâd be really stoked but the sad state of affairs that is Medical Marijuana in California is that itâs $45.00 an eighth and thatâs just too damn much.  You can pick up Cali-Orange for $100-120 a zip, and while it may not be as ârefinedâ it does a similar job and a far lower price.","strain":"xj-13","user":"chefstew1969","stars":"3","date":"4/13/2015 10:02 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Happy","Relaxed"],"ID":"346062"},{"_type":"dict","content":"not bad but overrated for sure","strain":"og-kush","user":"DrRobotDIKK","stars":"3","date":"4/13/2015 11:41 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"346063"},{"_type":"dict","content":"one hit wonder, took one bong toke and I'm feeling relaxed and happy.","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"The420Souljah","stars":"5","date":"4/13/2015 11:57 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Focused","Giggly","Happy","Relaxed","Talkative","Uplifted","Dry Mouth","Flowery","Skunk","Diesel"],"ID":"346064"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Really nice bud.

You'll see.) Anyway, OG Kush is sinister, wicked, and a wonderful vacation in limbo with no TSA searches. \n\nFive minutes and it's stroking your cerebral lobes like a skull whisperer. Fifteen and you find yourself staring at patterns in the carpet and thinking, \"I can't believe I just solved the world's problems! Wait... I think there's some Rocky Road in the... hold on, what was I thinking about problems?\" Next day: A bit foggy, and bizarre dreams that night.\n\nYeah, OG Kush is one of those Brain Cloud strains. Damn impressive, but a mind-smack separation from reality doesn't let you experience things -- it just separates you from reality. Weed this intense makes you feel like there's a thick blanket of gauze between you and the universe.

Emerald OG & Jack Herer first off, are great parents!\nAs far as sativa's go, this is what you're looking for. Simple as that. Has that nice sweet smell and taste, strong punch due to high THC count, and if grown well you'll see what its a plant you can't help but love.\n\n2. Back into saying that it's a Sativa, its not just a Sativa..\nits a clear headed, productive and still comfortable high that feeds creativity and overall produces such a sense of well being that you in turn, carry it into your day making for a real positive mood!\n\n& 3. For us who are \"nug porn\" pheens, this one is truly \"InstaGRAM\" friendly! Has a nice dark cupped leaf, around clusters of lighter colored leaves scattered with trichromes. Hairs reach out and hug the strain, but not in an array or cluster.

The goal was obviously a 'full experience' kind of high; Jack Herer for the head X G13 for the body.\n\nXJ-13 smells alot like Jack Herer with more spice: JH having a sort of chemical-soap-earthy flavor.  It isn't skunky, but you can tell there is some potency just from the sharp smell - it's very unique and different from the Chemdawg line (OG Kush, SD, etc.) that is so common at the moment.  The buds are dense little branchy nuggets - not round Kush-esque rocks or long airy Sativa buds either.  The color of the buds is a bright healthy green, almost neon, with dark orange/brown hairs.\n\nThis is a great strain for anyone who enjoys a strong hybrid high; it hits to the brain quickly, creating energy, euphoria, and creativity.  Shortly after, it moves into the body as well, causing some sedation, pain relief, and helping to nullify any anxiety caused by the initial blast.  The high lingers behind the eyes and can be quite spacey/medicated depending on how much you smoke - XJ-13 can quickly turn from a sativa-type high to a couch-lock medication depending on the amount smoked.  Really quite powerful stuff that can satisfy both Sativa and Indica lovers, but will be too strong for some to serve as a good daytime smoke.","strain":"xj-13","user":"BJW","stars":"5","date":"4/15/2015 4:39 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Relaxed","Sleepy","Uplifted","Lime","Pine","Chemical","Menthol","Spicy/Herbal","Sage","Mint"],"ID":"347374"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Decent strain.

This was the first time in 3 years I felt relaxed enough to fall asleep without pharm meds!!

Their lineup is all outstanding, so I was more than content trying something new.\nUpon getting home and opening the bag, I was overwhelmed with a strong, bitter citrus aroma that was obviously the cause for it's name. Mouthwatering and almost beckons you to bring your nose closer again for multiple whiffs.\nVisually, this sample was beautiful. Outstanding trichome production, nice sized & dense nug structure, with shades of green, royal purple, pastel yellow, & burnt orange pistils.\nThe flavor brought with it the same bitter citrus from the scent that was sweet/tart, again, reminiscent of real grapefruit. The effects were extremely sativa with a powerful head change, boost of energy, uplifted mood, increased creativity, focus, and even encouraged me to talk-ramble far more than usual, lol.\nOverall, this strain is absolutely outstanding. I'm more of an indica guy personally, but this is an incredible strain for wake & bake early in the morning. Roll a joint at night so you can wake up at sunrise with it ready to go (preferably in the Spring as I did). I sat outside on my porch watching the sun come up with a cup of coffee, a cool & fresh breeze on my face, with the sun's glare glistening off the dew still resting on the grass. An absolutely beautiful experience that was greatly improved by the cannabis. I'm sure it would be great in many other situations, but that morning will be embedded within my memory for the rest of my life. I will be picking this strain up again in the Summer for my morning/day time smoke while out on the lake. If you find a well-grown example with the characteristics I listed, pick some up and use it in rotation with 1-2 other strains throughout the day. You'll be happy you did and excited every morning which is something that doesn't happen to me often!

With that said, every once in a while I'll visit an establishment to pickup a few grams of 2-4 strains to add to my medicine cabinet to keep a good variety on hand. This was one of those strains that I had to have right when I saw it.\nVisually, this strain was absolutely gorgeous. Multiple shades of purple that ranged from a dark plum to vivid/bright. One of those strains that is \"more furry than frosty\", similar to Blackberry Kush & Chocolate Kush in my opinion. Still, so much white across these flowers, it was an incredible strain to look at. Bag appeal was a perfect score regardless of your grading scale and I'm not all that fond of \"purple\" strains to be honest with you.\nThe aroma was sweet. Nothing too distinct outside of smelling like dank, well grown cannabis. However, that terpene profile was deceptive because as soon as I started combusting it in my bong, the sweet scent had become a candied berry that was extremely smooth with very little expansion. Quite enjoyable to consume. Potency wasn't all that high (still adequate, probably around 18-20% if I had to guess), but the effects were nice, mellow, and clear headed. \nOverall, this strain was outstanding in the evenings or before bed. Sedative, relaxing, great flavor, and helped my insomnia. A good strain for funny movies before bed, video games, as an appetite stimulant, reading a good book, or even to browse around online and BS on forums. This strain won't make you feel stupid if you go a little overboard on amount you consume and I found myself reaching for this strain almost every night while I had it. Pictures will be included here on Leafly for your enjoyment (will be snapped with a bright blue background, for reference). I hope you all enjoy them as well as the review. If grown well, I highly recommend giving this strain a try.","strain":"purple-berry","user":"PieRomania","stars":"4","date":"4/16/2015 2:35 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Focused","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Dry Mouth","Sweet","Berry"],"ID":"348684"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"amnesia","user":"prumster0706","stars":"5","date":"4/16/2015 2:36 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"348685"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"silver-haze","user":"Woodrow19","stars":"3","date":"4/16/2015 2:43 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"348686"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"white-widow","user":"c1ware","stars":"4","date":"4/16/2015 3:54 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"348687"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"chemdawg","user":"leafly0xo","stars":"3","date":"4/16/2015 1:33 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"348714"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"sweet-cheese","user":"Mast3rYoda","stars":"4","date":"4/16/2015 3:12 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"348715"},{"_type":"dict","content":"great head high, upbeat not sleepy. this is deff a new fave","strain":"dream-queen","user":"purpledreams35","stars":"5","date":"4/16/2015 3:18 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Talkative","Uplifted","Sweet","Berry"],"ID":"348716"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Made me feel reallllly good\n","strain":"girl-scout-cookie","user":"woldy412","stars":"5","date":"4/16/2015 3:54 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Giggly","Happy","Relaxed"],"ID":"348717"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-dream","user":"tomerzadaka","stars":"4","date":"4/16/2015 5:09 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"348718"},{"_type":"dict","content":"It's a nice strain with a hint of an earthy aroma.

The effect is immediate, felt before exhaling your hit even, but then seems to disappear shortly, only to return in full force, and disappear once again.  Very wavey high in that way.  Very thai-like effect as I have heard \"thai-weed\" described.  An effect that can certainly lead to \"over-smoking,\" however, the Afghan Kush influence in Flo, balances the high nicely.  Once you have smoked a good dose (for me a full bowl), you feel comfortably euphoric, giggly, and medicated, with bursts of psychedelia.

That's how quick this gets you jacked out of your mind.\n\nEvery draw zaps your visual cortex with the force of a hundred woodstock eighths. Little moments of surreality scatter away from your focus while your brain recovers its composure. This stuff burns acrid and hits instantly.\n \nThis is an indica, and unsurprisingly you're gonna be chillin like the fish at the budget Sushi restaurant isn't. But this isn't a \"melt into a plush couch and giggle through vintage Hostess cakes at the Seth Rogan movies you're watching through the spaces between your eyelashes\" kind of chill.\n\nThis is a \"sit back and hold on because we're about to chill the fuck out, motherfucker\" kind of chill.\n\nThis is agitating. You're going to be chilled out whether you like it or not, and the aggression is going to shock you into boyish shyness so you're definitely not going to like it at first, but it's going to happen anyway and after the first time it's not so bad but boy oh boy that first time is a ride.\n\nYou're chill and you know it. Jokes are aggressively funny.  You scratch a little too much or too hard at times. The spiders are either under your skin, or you're inside out and the spiders are really on top of your skin. You imagine at least once that this might be what autistic children feel all the time.\n\nThis is the kind of strain that makes me wonder how seriously we should take the warnings from the medical community that cannabis use is associated with psychotic events or even schizophrenia.\n\nThen comes the opiate. At some point through this review, which I started right after a king-size of God's Gift, shit got very real very fast. I don't know where exactly it happened, but it occurs to me that I've been staring into space for some time now.\n\n---\n\ntl;dr: Use this if your condition involves not having a burst of energy to clean your room before crashing hard into opioid bliss.\n\n---\n\nFour stars because it has a weird burn like it's got nicotine in it.

Prefer Tilray packaging ever so slightly, because more recyclable. The actual weed vessel from Tweed (jar) is SO much better, though. Buds on the smaller side, doubt any >0.4g, but most probably at least a tad >0.2g.\n\nNot much vapour before 360-370F. Smelled cheese when stirring, though. Then, at 405, suddenly tasted very strong Cheeze Whiz. Not my favourite, but alright, I guess. Better than later sessions, which were closer to blue cheese (do not like). Had Cheeze Whiz again today, though. Makes me want something cheesy to eat! For that matter, bad munchies for just about anything. Also, enhanced flavour to foods! Think nausea a smidge worse, though. Talkative, but kept getting tongue-tied over simple words.\n\nFirst session, found myself stretching in my chair, so turned off the vape and went to do my stretches. Quickly backed off to halfway on knee-to-chest, because so intensely agonizing. Didn't do bending over in chair after, as a result. Still hurting and much more tender next day, though could also be partly from a doctor visit earlier yesterday.\n\nAt the peak, have often been itchy, so far. But, can't feel when I scratch on the surface, only my fingers. Part of this is a mild numb/floaty feeling. Also much happier. Damn sleepy when it wears off, though!\n\nAlready used a full gram as I write this. Why did that chick mess up the registrations!

Those ranging from a bodily sense of relaxation and content, to a very heady, and euphoric high. By \"heady,\" I mean that it manifests very noticeably in the head with a pleasurable pressure. Its cerebral effect is different than that of a good Sativa. It's there, but to a lesser degree. Perhaps because those effects are experienced differently, in a more mellow way. This strain is comprised of hybrids within hybrids, so perhaps it would be keen to say that there are a number of different forces at work, in terms of the effects it provides. Perhaps the most notable of these effects is the absolute euphoria that arises. Very high-vibe strain in that way, and it sends your vibration through the roof. Made me insanely happy. In this way, it's perfect for treating stress and depression, while making it all too easy to find things to crack up about. It is a relaxing euphoria that makes you realize that you love everything, which is unbelievably uplifting. For me, I found it even very spiritually uplifting.\n\nThe buds are very dense. When I first saw my new herb, I thought, \"Jesus. This is an eighth?\" Yes, it was weighed accurately, but a lot of that weight is in the density of the plant matter. Said plant matter is green to light green, modestly displaying small tinges of purple here and there.\n\nThe smell is great. Probably the sweetest smelling herb I've sniffed. It is also very buttery smelling, hence the name. There are notes of fruitiness as well, but it's hard to say that it smells grape-y. Though, it does kind of smell like \"purple,\" if you understand that flavor profile. The other attributes to its scent are hard to place. Great vaping experience. Easy on the way in, easy on the way out. Not as much lung expansion as some of my beloved Sativas.\n\nFantastic herb.","strain":"696a0aba-e35b-4159-96db-c5ae3f33c28f","user":"FromElsewhere","stars":"4","date":"4/19/2015 7:10 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Talkative","Uplifted","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth","Sweet","Grape","Butter"],"ID":"351381"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"death-star","user":"visticar","stars":"5","date":"4/19/2015 7:46 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"351382"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"cali-kush","user":"nando423","stars":"5","date":"4/19/2015 11:30 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"351383"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"purple-kush","user":"thejtizzle","stars":"4","date":"4/19/2015 1:08 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize"],"ID":"351384"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"cannalope-haze","user":"krunz","stars":"5","date":"4/19/2015 2:23 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"351385"},{"_type":"dict","content":"fav strain of mine, Zen dispensary just opened a mile from me and I just tried the maui waui.

It is a great auto flower strain that is indicia dominate and looks as purple as the picture on the seed banks. \n\n\n100% Autoflowering strain. This is the result of the hybridization between one of our most appreciated autoflowering genetics - Big Devil XL - and an exotic autoflowering strain with purple flowers, developed with the collaboration of the R + D department of the seedbank Buddha Seeds â feminized seeds. The purple characteristic of this strain is inherited from its ancestors from the Chitral region in the Pakistani Hindu Kush, very close to Afghanistan. The purple genetics contribute for a faster flowering period, bringing new sweet aromas and purple colours to our Big Devil XL. Dark Devil shows a strong hybrid vigour since germination. Plants grow with the appearance of Indica-Sativa hybrids with a strong main stem and numerous side branches, finishing with a big main cola and multiple smaller buds on the side branches. Resin production is abundant in the flowers and in their surrounding leaves. Sweet and fruity aroma with hints of incense and delightful citrus tones. During flowering, around 80% of the plants acquire purple or reddish tones in the buds and some of them even develop purple leaves too. After harvested and dried the buds gain a very dark purple tone, almost black.

Moderate sized nugs with an above average amount of trichomes. Beautiful rust colored hairs filled the buds. They were very sticky and glistened in the light. Had a very lemon-like, yet pungent smell. Around 10 bong rips were enough to keep me high from around 9:30am to the time of writing this at around 7pm. This strain gives you a very detached feeling, almost like you've been anesthetized or used something like Ketamine. It's like your brain and body cannot communicate and you have difficulty with basic motor skills, similar to being drunk. The high starts off with you becoming very happy and giggly then mellows out to a couch lock a couple hours in. Overall, you remain relaxed, but creative and patient. All of my stress and pain was eliminated leaving in a very devil-may-care attitude. I didn't get as hungry as I would if I'd smoked something like Blue Dream, but is was substantial. Muscle spasms and twitches were common, I also experienced minor auditory and visual hallucinations and bouts of moderate paranoia. This strain is not for the faint of heart. Using a bong with ice cubes is the preferred method of usage since I found that using a pipe gives a very harsh smoke and burns the back of the throat. I used only a gram or so of my 1/4 for just two people. Quality of this strain over quantity. 1/8 is more than enough for one person to enjoy a good smoke after a long day of work.\n\n9.5/10 Will Smoke Again","strain":"lemon-kush","user":"GanjaGangsta","stars":"5","date":"4/21/2015 12:15 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Creative","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Tingly","Uplifted","Dizzy","Dry Mouth","Paranoid","Citrus","Lemon","Pungent"],"ID":"352235"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Nice, Focused High...a little energetic...Nice High 4:20","strain":"orange-juice","user":"JloSmokey","stars":"4","date":"4/21/2015 12:15 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"352236"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I grew 4 of these ladies out doors last season, and we refer to her as stomach ache go bye bye !!

This strain is not indica dominant. This is false definition for this strain. I would split it 80%Sativa and 20%Indica. I have been smoking for the past two days and let me tell this stuff is one of the best strains i had so far. It feels like the THC level is at least around 25%. This is just my estimate ;) \nIf you are beginner take it easy with this strain. This is medical MJ so remember that. I have been smoking MJ since the beginning of 2005. I would take breaks in between. My longest break from MJ was about one year. Even for smoker like me this strain is strong. After first bowl i usually get really uplifted and start doing things such as watvh a movie,play my WOT game or listen to some Psyprogressive trance ( highly recommend will get you in nice mood. The intense high can last from 60-90 mins depending on tolerance. I usually do not wait that long and smoke a bowl 30-45 mins between smokes but remember i have been smoking weed everyday for the past 6 months ;) \nFor me after like 4-5 bowl indica starts creep on me. The high until that point is pretty clear no paranoia. It allows to be functional. I have cock really good dish after 3 bowls. The food was great. The indica effect are very pleasant but not overwhelming like you will get with indica dominant hybrid or indica strain. \nOverall it is a great strain.

This strain still makes me want to be active, but the tightness in my shoulders and neck are not as distinctive, basically I have to think about it to feel it. \nAs for the psychoactivity of this strain, it is well-balanced, doesn't make me feel lethargic, and I can focus when I need to.

With Ewok, I find myself very interested in the process of creation, and can maintain interest with practicing over and over to correct imperfections.  Lastly, Ewok has the perfect balance of Sativa and Indica: it keeps me awake and alert but calm and relaxed and receptive.  In short, it keeps me clear headed and awake but relaxed, with good concentration and focus, and with enhanced sensation.  I may try some other strains to see if I can get even more of these qualities, but I'm not sure why: this strain must be about as good as it gets.","strain":"ewok","user":"bialerwest","stars":"5","date":"4/25/2015 6:42 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Creative","Focused","Relaxed"],"ID":"357721"},{"_type":"dict","content":"It was a mellow indica high","strain":"jane-doe","user":"janeshannon","stars":"3","date":"4/25/2015 8:44 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth","Sweet","Rose","Earthy"],"ID":"357722"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Hawai'i '78 x Skywalker OG Kush x Obama Kush...;-)","strain":"0c60aee5-9d4c-4a35-87f6-02eec29ebad3","user":"PuaManaPakalolo","stars":"5","date":"4/25/2015 10:00 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Happy","Tropical","Flowery","Earthy","Diesel"],"ID":"357723"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I felt both head and body high, my batch had some purps.

So many strains help in their own way, others not so much at all.  High CBD potential marijuana like this particular cut when grown to their fullest potential, and this one was is a true dream.  From time to time we need medication that is quiet yet effective.  Then when by some miracle a grower lets it go and you are able to get some, say goodbye to the dr. pills and hello to mellow-yellow-focus in-no stress-EASY like Sunday morning (not the Lionel Ritchie version, but Faith no More version).  Worst part about the strains is the availability and associated higher costs.  But if you can find a way to jump that hurdle then by all means you should check out these frosty conical, dense, shiny nugs of earthy goodness.  Think Lambs bread without the heady âjah manâ aspect and youâve got the picture.  While I find the taste earthy and woody, there is supposed to be some pine in there, this did not but youâll not miss it if you were not expecting it.

But that is hardly the point.  We pay all that money to get high.  But for me...I found the EdiPure Raspberries to be more on the medicinal side of MJ experience.   It could have just been the batch that I got.  There is more fog and not as much trip, if you know what I mean.  I just felt spaced-out like I took a bunch of cold medicine, which was comfy enough if that is what you are looking for.  But I like a more euphoric head trip to take me places creatively.   This didn't do that nearly as effectively.   I'm experienced, but not a heavy MJ user at all and consider my tolerance on the lower side.  But one jelly was definitely not enough.  About the potency of strong cough syrup.  Taking two thickened the fog enough to acknowledge that I was high, but it didn't feel \"high\".. just cloudier.  Eventually I could take enough to feel trippy but it wasn't the euphoric type.  Was honestly glad to come down.   And I feel like I know what I am doing with edibles, not taking them on empty stomach and whatnot. I would only buy these again if I was looking to dull some pain or ease insomnia.  But recreationally they were a little bit of a letdown.   So far I have had much better experience with TinctureBelle products over the EdiPure stuff.   But that is not a rule.  I am willing to try again based on other reviews.

I am not a fan of Chocolope on it's own but I guess I like it when crossed like this.  Glad Max raises the bar for me when it comes to my head high.  I don't feel high, I fill lifted and clear headed and more focused then Moby Dick which had an odd stony quality that would come on after about an hour I found myself getting easily distracted.\n\nMother's Helper makes me want to get up and do something which I really like about the strain.  Glad Max is a bit more mellow and relaxed energy.  It elevates my head high and cuts through any Spacyness.. Also good for muscle issues and anxiety.  \n\nYou can definetly a difference in the bud structure.  Mother's Helper has more popcorn like bud consistency and is more a muted green.  Glad Max is a darker richer green with what looks like a 50 - 50 mix of hairs to bud.  The bud looks kind of gritty like sandpaper  Don't get if you are wanting to sleep or couch lock.\n\nI have smoked and vaped.

Pain free: this strain has the right cannabiniods! A very light weight body energy which is great for work as this strain is totally functional. Very positive and optimistic feeling. This is a winner for sure: the best medicinal high ever!!!!! Again, clear headed yet calm yet still energetic high: this is the one! Its working like prescription level ADD meds and antidepressants combined together! Perfect for my issues. Feels like people are following me around and cheering me on when im doing work by myself where id normally feel like I was about to die lol So definitely no paranoia like some other strains! This is the one for anytime of the day work or play: yes, this is the one: i won't even smoke OG kush for fun lol there is good reason why the medical community in holland chooses this one out of all the strains available there: this really is a superior ultra potent-fast growing medicine for anytime of the day or night. Not trippy at all in low to moderate doses and not much body effects besides pain releif and energy of course. \n              For ultra recreational fun id go with  a different sativa leaning hybrid like el dorado,  or the lazy yet energetic utopian death star, or maybe  a 50/50 like AK-47 if i wanted an ultra trippy high with full boddy buzz. But Lemon Kush is the best ultra potent functional high for any social occation for sure.If your looking for a good indica leaning hybrid for medical/recreational go with critical mass (skunkXafghan) or barney farms LSD (mazarXskunk, the skunk cross completely cuts down the paranioa of the ultra trippy mazar). Lastly, Spoetnik #1 is the best indica leaning hybrid for christmas time.

Ideal for creatives (or anyone who enjoys the following), Red Congo creates a clear headed high, giving a feeling of separation between ones mind and body.\nCons: For those who don't have the pleasure of living around the bay area, this landrace sativa is quite difficult to come by.\nConclusion: Even though seldom available to people outside of California, she shouldn't be underestimated; Red Congolese gives the user an incredibly compelling and cerebrally-focused high, while causing one to suffer few noticeably negative effects (for me, not even dry mouth), creating a pleasant, memorable experience, that will have even the most Indica-obsessed individual rushing to San Francisco to get more.","strain":"red-congolese","user":"Delsin","stars":"5","date":"4/29/2015 7:39 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Focused","Uplifted","Earthy","Woody","Spicy/Herbal","Pepper"],"ID":"359341"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I vaped the flowers and made some into tincture.

It was just labeled as Power Plant in the shop (and this shop has mis-labeled strains in the past) but the smell and color profile were in line with what I had read about Power Plant.  So; heads up to those who don't know;  there is a completely different strain called \"Pure Power Plant\" bred by Nirvana (and I believe White Label now), in addition to Power Plant, which was originally bred by Dutch Passion BEFORE other seed companies. It can have similar effects in some of the phenotypes of the two different strains which adds to the confustion, and it has been speculated by many growers that PPP was derived from the original Power Plant and hybridized.  \"Power Plant\" and \"Pure Power Plant\" are consistently mis-labeled and interchanged in dispensaries and generate much confusion; as I read these reviews, I can't know for sure if they were written about PPP, or PP, because the reviewers can't know for sure either (unless they grew it from seed themselves).  I just wanted to give a sorta PSA to everybody that when you buy \"Power Plant\" or \"Pure Power Plant\" these days, there is a decent chance you're not getting the one you think you're getting. My first experience with \"Power Plant\" was so amazing I decided to grow it for myself.  But I won't know until harvest if the stuff I smoked was \"Pure Power Plant\" or \"Power Plant.\"  I certainly hope it was the original Power Plant because it was the most existential experience I've ever had - completely in line with all other South African genetics I've encountered.\nA word to the wise!

Great day time smoke that is not crushing but also doesn't induce anxiety like some sativa dominant strains.  The effects of Rosebud rest right in the middle between an indica and a sativa and are great for sunny summer day.  A cross between Northern Lights #5 and Cherry Bomb, Rosebud is very stable from seed form showing most of its variation in flavor and harvest weight.  Bred by Allele Seeds Research in Seattle, Washington Rosebud stays short with little stretch during flowering and grows bushy but with an open internode structure.  A short flowering period of 7-8 weeks along with good resistance to powdery mildew and pests allows for Rosebud to succeed outdoors as well as indoors.","strain":"dcd7aac7-13b6-4484-8c3a-df4b90df3739","user":"erasmosis","stars":"4","date":"4/29/2015 11:25 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Sweet","Flowery","Rose"],"ID":"360141"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Very Strong high, Very hungry and wanted to relax, No energy","strain":"white-rhino","user":"PurpleKushGuy","stars":"4","date":"4/30/2015 12:09 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Giggly","Happy","Relaxed","Talkative","Uplifted"],"ID":"360142"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Allele Seeds Research found three seeds in a sample from Seattle producers Dama oil's Sour Diesel.

How do I start this one?   This is conflicting. Get comfy..  This is gonna be a long review!!\n\nI read so much about the phenomenal effects of this strain, but the THC of the GSC I got was not around the 30% mark like many say, Mine was closer to 16%.  I got mine the day it was released by Tilray.  I also ordered 15 Grams of it thinking I had better get a good amount before everyone orders it out.  So I placed the order on the Thursday and had it sent from BC that day and it was at my door in Ontario the NEXT DAY!!  (Woo-Hoo!)  Everything was good till I tried to Vape it..  It seemed to not Vape well..  Like it was still a bit \"Too Fresh\".. (If that is even possible.)  It did not last long in the Vape and I had to refill the bowl much sooner than I thought I should need to and the smoke was never really there, like it was still too wet, even though it was dry.   It is better now after a few days but still.  I mix mine up now with several other strains.  I mix the Girl Scout Cookies with, Nordle, a touch of Cheese (Only because Cheese is really hard on my throat), Fruit Spirit, Cannatonic, LA Confidential, Super silver haze and Headband.  (I will occasionally swap the Cannatonic with the 14% CBD with the Super Silver Haze) but MY GOD!  The effects of this blend is PHENOMINAL!!  It makes you tingle in all the \"RIGHT PLACES!\"  :-)  And the arousal level is through the roof!!  I thought it was a 1-off but after 3 days in a row I am convinced it is because of my blending of these different strains.  The first night my wife and I were at it for over 3 hours!  The next night was 5 then the night after that was 7 HOURS!!!!  from 10:30 till 5:30 AM!!!!  Of course there were a few couple minute pee brakes mixed in there LOL! The next night was only like 20 minutes..  We were too tired from the night before!  LOL!!!\n\nNow I know I have gone off topic here by quite a bit, but GSC is a part of this blend that I do.  Granted nobody has all the strains that I do and can mix them the way like I do, but the point that I am trying to make for those that are really new to this like I kinda am, is simply this...    It is OK to mix different strains together and smoke/vape it.  You may even be surprised...  Pleasantly, like I am!  If you do not have a vaporizer,  REALLY recommend you get one!  You will actually \"TASTE\" the strain as opposed to tasting the burning paper and the cigarette-like taste.  Vaping will make it taste better.  MUCH better.  They are not expensive and are well worth the plunge to buy one.  I will NEVER smoke a joint again!  That is how good a vaporizer is!\n\n Now as for this strain specifically on it's own, I am not sure about \"Highly recommending\" this strain, but it is worth a try, but pay attention to the THC in the one you are ordering as I didn't really do that so this may be why my review is not as glowing about GSC as others may be!  As for the length of the effects, I was feeling good for about an hour or so then just a few hits to top up and all was good, but again the first time was disappointing due to the issues I stated above.  I did not get too hungry and eat more than I normally do, like other strains that do that to me.  My pains are Mid-back, knees, heels and overall lethargy, like I can NOT get out of 1'st gear no matter how much I try!.

As the sky darkened and friends departed I was left with my regular smoking buddy; a relatively new, relatively large bong; and four grams of Bubba Kush.\n\nThe flowers were big, dense and healthy. Covered with sparkling trichomes and faint orange pistils, the forest green bud had a sweet smell of exactly that, a forest. The nice earthy aroma wasn't as prominent when combusted but there was still a pleasant naturally sugary taste, emphasised by the cool smoke from the ice catch in the bong.\n\nThe high was pretty immediate and hit hard. My body slumped into a chair and my thoughts transported to a million miles away.

The Wu#1 was created by Wubby who provided the male pollen from a Reclining Buddha and Cassel who provided the female Cream. Ironically it was a mutual friend who killed that Genetic off in an accident, he thought it was something else we had duplicate moms of. Luckly the previous run had produced accidental seed pops from a Blueberry Haze hermie coming into contact with the Wu#1. Those seeds would become the basis of the R4 and three years of inbreeding has lead too the current version. All of this was done without the help of a person we both know. Unless he gets credit for killing the Wu#1 which in turn lead me to pop our accidental seed pop. No I'm not a brilliant Breeder but also not a thief. What I am trying to do is make CBD's available too all sick people at reduced cost as cannabis is not covered by Medicare or any health plan\"\n\nCool back-story, would love to here for sure if it is true, but matches genetics posted on Greenwerkz's website around the time they first released R4.\n\nMy personal experience is this:  Must smoke a full, jam packed full, bowl if you are smoking R4 by itself, to feel any effect similar to \"drug-type\" Cannabis.  However, that full bowl with certainly calm you down, and make you appreciate what you have in life.  It will quell your anxiety too.

In all respects, weaker than Tilray's regular Cheese. When doing really badly yesterday, took 0.4g (2 bowls) and still didn't have enough pain relief. Today, it put me to sleep after an hour or two.\n\nAll the Usual Suspects, particularly dry eyes - had to close them while finishing session, because they were burning so badly.

I felt very talkative (which is different considering I do have social anxiety, and a lot of strains leave me quiet and unable to speak as much as I'd like). I'd call this a very functional high, you feel very happy and energized (good for depression). Everyone that has tried it with me liked the high it gave them as well. Bought an 1/8th for $30.00 @ Green Door in SF, a bit pricey but worth it most definitely. Very very pungent aroma so I have to keep it sealed if it's in my bag.
