There aren't really any uplifting effects, so for depression or similar problems, look elsewhere.

I've been trying to get over my strange fear by smoking small amounts again. I think what caused my strange fear is that \"stoner-minutes\" and affects like that always freaked me out.\n\nANYWAY a few friends brought over some Durban, saying it was a Sativa (my favorite) and that it sounded like something I might want to try. At first I mainly took the sloppy-seconds from their hits, but ended up taking enough to get high. I felt no paranoia, I did feel energized and happy, and it COMPLETELY got rid of my visual snow during the duration.\n\n Later when I was on the come-down I ended up taking my own hits, and maybe took a bit too much for a light-weight like me. After the last few hits I took, I remember walking into my house and just kinda.... nope. I was gone. I sat on my couch with my muscles feeling so relaxed I could hardly move and my thoughts racing, I couldn't keep a subject on my mind for more than one second. This was probably the highest I've ever been (I'm a mega-lightweight and usually just stick to a few reasonable hits for my anxiety and visual snow) and usually when I've had this much, I freak out. But it was actually pleasant this time. Like of course I would have rather not been as high, but I wasn't flipping a bitch.\n\nComing down was nice and relaxing, it did make me feel sleepy, but not like I was going to pass out any second.\n\nSorry for the long review... but I usually like when people go into detail so.. hah.","strain":"durban-poison","user":"Keik0","stars":"5","date":"4/24/2014 11:29 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Creative","Talkative","Tingly","Relaxed","Anxious","Dry Eyes","Earthy","Woody","Skunk"],"ID":"150316"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Loved the way it made me feel.

It eases mental tension, mildly relaxing the body, but without sedation. Rather, it invites an elevation of awareness (so that one's focus may transcend one's running day-to-day narrative) and allows a sense of play. The urge to move and create is ignited: go find a tennis court, a beach, or a mountain...or maybe find a park and throw a frisbee around with your best friend (whose shit you can suddenly deal with). I don't know what you like to do...maybe you'd prefer a quiet spot in the sun to knit while your puppy chases a goddamn butterfly, or just sit down at your fucking computer for a while to type up a strain review before your head explodes. The point is White Widow is anything but a sleeping pill;  it gets you relaxed and gets you going without the unbridled mania of a pure sativa .

Growers don't mess with it because they're difficult to get to flower properly (and most new growers don't want the negative mark against them). The buds are long/stringy and strongly smell of lemon ammonia...it's unmistakable. The magnificent WHITE frosting is unique unto itself, and the smoke very strong (for even frequent smokers).

An indica-dominant, but still very energetic, heady strain that contains strong flavors and smells of coffee, skunk, and just plain funk, is exactly what I get every time.  I like to think of the Bruce Banner aroma as that of a very straight forward Kush of the OG persuasion, but containing slightly less of a citrus flavor than true OG.\n\nThis high launches with a distinct, low-intensity tingling in my face which quickly extends over my whole body.  My mood begins to improve dramatically, even if I'm already very happy!  Anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes after that, the creativity begins to kick in and is easily applied to whatever I'm doing at the moment.  My high from Bruce Banner is one of the longer cannabis highs I've ever experienced and can last up to 4 hours.\n\nHigh Times has listed this bud among a few strains that contain the highest THC percentage ever tested in a non-concentrate bud form.  The 3.6 grams I purchased today from Golden Leaf was tested at 28.3% THC!!!

The normal super -sativa's don't grind up well (it's a finger feel). You'll notice they're not hard and compact like indica's, but a little looser and longer. \nMy experience after 'smoking' a few hits was super enjoyable. I felt great! As usual , the grower at this place had extracted \"the very best\" that true Jillybean is known for.\nLike Dr. Who (aka Dr. Grinspoon),\nthat I'd sampled here with great satisfaction , Jilly is very hard to grow. \nIf you've tried Jillybean and were not instantly delighted, then go to Altitude for some tested/true Jilly.

Actually, true to its \"Bubble Gum\" name, I felt more salivation, which might make it a great addition to other strains to counter-act the terrible dry mouth that say GDP gives. Other than that I can't say anything fantastic about the strain. It's pretty consistent among other Kush varieties, except maybe OG Kush which is a Sativa (thx Leafly for that clarification). I'm looking for PAIN MANAGEMENT and this strain definitely holds that \"fools gold\" effect for pain, where perhaps it distracts you enough for a mental distraction for 10-15 minutes at a time, but compared to some of the sage flavored sugar hash and other \"unknown\" concentrates I've used, it's nothing. I believe one of the only ways to deal with nerve pain is to purposefully induce couch-lock, thus smoking any strain by itself might not be what I should be doing. I think I will stick to my pursuit of Blueberry & Blue Haze (which I have had a difficult time finding). I think I just need something a bit more over the top - but I know ... So many strains, so little time, and everyone responds a little differently; almost too many factors. \nI think I taste Hubba Bubba BubbleGum from 198? after about 10 minutes of smoking.

Comes down easy.","strain":"orange-crush","user":"angryjon","stars":"4.5","date":"5/2/2014 4:57 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Euphoric","Citrus","Sage"],"ID":"153092"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Succkkky shit don't buy it you hate this shit","strain":"jack-herer","user":"morbidmunchkin","stars":"0.5","date":"5/2/2014 6:40 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Creative","Hungry","Paranoid","Anxious","Headache","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"153093"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"platinum-girl-scout-cookies","user":"charity.hays","stars":"4.5","date":"5/2/2014 7:11 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Talkative","Creative"],"ID":"153094"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-dream","user":"sd7","stars":"5","date":"5/2/2014 9:20 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Giggly","Relaxed","Talkative","Euphoric"],"ID":"153095"},{"_type":"dict","content":"An powerful body high, tingly from head to toes however it doesn't seem like a psychoactive high vert much.

I chose the \"smoking\" route, and while I increased the dose over the course of 5 or 6 hours in the evening, the pain never subsided or diminished in any way.  My head got fuzzy, my vision got blurry, I even got to the point where I was unable to focus on simple tasks (like get a glass of ice water from the kitchen) and became mildly hallucinatory.  At that point (obviously), I ceased increasing the \"medication\".  The effects lingered another 3 or so hours, then left me with a significant headache.

Worked quickly to reduce my pain and I spent a few hours with the family then slept well. I did get itchy that night but I suspect that was from over heating in bed since I forgot to turn the fan on before bed and I have a mast cell \n\n4/24/2014\nPer dispensary: King's Kush CBD. \n5.12 % THC \n9.55% CBD \nAn indica, high CBD strain. \n\nSurprisingly sticky. My first truly high CBD, lower THC variety. I sprinkled this on a pork rib to make my own edible, so wasn't sure how much to use and started off small. Reduced my pain quite a bit! Did not make me feel that \"High\" which was good. I did get sleepy which was fine as I took it before bed.\n\ntried it again 2 days ago when I had a migraine and leg and back pain. It allowed me to go back to working on my art for an upcoming show and I was able to get my projects finished on time for the deadline! This stuff is great in my new vaporizer, it does not make me fall asleep, and does make it so I can get work done. Reduces enough pain to function, tho I would need to use more or mix in a higher thc strain if I wanted total pain relief. At bed time I added in a bit of Blue Dream to help take away the last of the pain and get some sleep. Did the trick, and only needed a tiny inhale. Together, it was a great bed time combination, on it's own, this stuff is great for the day time.

It is so good many rappers in the Atlanta area - go out of their way for anything with OG in the title - because they get blown away by the strength of different blends. And it is hard to beat the Oregon/Original Ghost Kush - OG Kush - stinky, funky, even a fruity/cheesy taste and room filling smell.  It is easy to get so high you temporarily get stuck in your head. \nSnoop Dogg & Friends in LA are outspoken about the OG Kush hardcore party weed vibe.\nRed Dragon, however, is moving toward becoming the \"it\" weed, now.  While OG Kush gives you a powerful stoners rush - Red Dragon gives a super long THC mind altering experience that would be good for both creative artists or partiers going to a music concert.  It alleviates anxiety, allows for focus, so you can enjoy whatever you are doing while on it.  Aphrodisiac quality - a super sexy high - with an exotic guava fruit taste and smell.\nIf you want to test yourself on being able to handle your weed - the only thing currently that takes it to the next level has OG Kush as a grandchild of a cannabis strain development effort -called Elektraslide.  When it comes to pushing cannibinoid levels Elektraslide is a freak offspring plant from Holy Grail Kush and SAGE - both in the top 5 strongest weeds tested potency in the world.  Lemon, chalky, alien haze goes down smooth, but expands in the lungs quickly.  It takes down even the most advanced or experienced smoker.  The THC is stratospheric, but so is the CBD, and CBN numbers.  The Holy Grail Kush had two of the highest cannabinoid levels in being Kosher Kush x OG Kush.  The incredibly high THCa content comes from SAGE pushes the complimentary THC genetics even higher than previously thought possible.  Gives a highly tingly body rush with electric currents racing over the skin, if over half a pin joint is smoked.  It also tends to lock a person down, while doing the above.  Elektraslide is still not in the commercial market.  Got a taste from an underground Atlanta connection.  Most memorable smoke in the last 30 years.  My guess is that it could probably help someone who is dealing with pain in the right dosage.","strain":"og-kush","user":"EcoBGreen","stars":"5","date":"5/7/2014 9:24 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Sleepy","Pungent","Honey","Citrus","Tobacco","Cheese","Orange","Lemon"],"ID":"154955"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Don't pass this one up if you can find it.","strain":"y-griega","user":"anon713","stars":"5","date":"5/7/2014 10:58 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Euphoric","Creative","Happy","Uplifted","Relaxed","Sleepy"],"ID":"154956"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"amnesia","user":"meef.","stars":"5","date":"5/7/2014 11:52 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Relaxed","Focused"],"ID":"154957"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This was a smooth I wanna say minty or Evan kind pine/citrus taste.

There is not too much Sativa impact so I can do what I have to do every day.  There is not enough Indica to hold me down, although if I choose to laze out and sleep, I can.  The main thing is that if I need to get up and go, I can do so and not be too medicated.  The effect lasts long enough so that it is effective for pain, keeps the migraines at bay, and doesn't cause anxiety.   These meds bring me out of my depression and for me are exactly what the doctor ordered.

This is an experience like no other you have ever experienced with Weed.\n\nI mean I loaded less then half a bowl by mistake instead of a full bowl to smoke this and literally I was so high I began tripping balls off one bowl, and I didn't even mix any kief or hash into it at all. I was medicated for a phenomenal 5 to 7 hours before I needed to take another hit, and the entire time I was so energetic I felt I could walk across the entire world.\n\nThe buzz is very Sativa, uplifting and endlessly energetic, but with just enough of an Indica stone to eliminate any paranoia and I had none. You will need Visine for this one, your eyes get so red you could plant tomatoes.\n\nCreativity is boundless on this strain, as it is easily the most Psychedelic strain of Weed you will smoke bar none. I was staring at my ceiling fan, watching mountains with eyeballs procreate on my ceiling, listening to the Grateful Dead flow out and in through my walls. I was writing lyrics and stories for hours with no end in sight!\n\nIf your looking for a strain to make you sleep, this strain is NOT for you you will be up all night on this shit but you will be so happy you literally will not care at all.

Now that its in your house you will undoubtedly begin to break up this amazing nugget of happiness, at which point the scent will begin to flower into a glorious bouquet, tainting the air with a tinge that makes your mouth water. When you finally put a flame to your newly acquired vegetation your taste buds will be slammed on the first hit with a flavor that mirrors the smell of this bud in a way few others can, it is in short everything you would expect it to be. With each hit you take the pungent flavor notes begin to recede bit by bit until they settle on a plateau where they tease your desire for the unique flavor. It is usually at this point that one begins to realize just how medicated they have become, your mind is racing brilliantly darting seamlessly from one conceptualization to the next making new connections between bits of information you have stored away and in turn creating a new cache of ideas and information.

So yummy in fact that after trying it I had to return and get some more.  \n\nWhen you open the jar and take a whiff you are greeted with a splash of pungent sour that quickly turns into a smooth cheese.  Colored in a light to medium green and absolutely covered in orange hairs and glistening trichomes these buds are dense and cured to perfection.  The buds release a satisfying snap that throws trichomes into the air when broken from the stems.  \n\nI always blaze my flowers out of a bong and as usual with cheese, this has a thick yet very smooth smoke that doesn't leave you coughing.  As the effects set in you definitely feel a dryness to the eyes and mouth.  The high is very relaxed and not too heady, and after a few bowls my teeth were a bit tingly.  It is definitely a functional high.  I wouldn't say it was energetic, but I wasn't fatigued or \"couch-locked\" at all.  \n\nI happen to try this at the end of a sinus.. thing.   This bud will dry up your entire head, so if you have sinus issues (allergies) that leave your nose runny be aware of that.

After 8 weeks of flowering, Blue OG can be cut and put into curing. If you can go 9-10 weeks of flowering, the plant will continue to grow and amaze you with its late growth. Blue OG has a deep sea-green color to its buds once broken apart, which reveals its deep blue genetics from its Blueberry (F3) and Blue Moonshine cross. Blue OG is great medicine for anyone suffering from bi-polar disorder, anxiety, CNS pain, and depression. The pain relief from Blue OG, alone, is enough to knock out a migraine and even depress/eliminate pain from diabetic neuropathy. The only negative side effect from this strain is possibly a dry mouth or dry eyes.

Once exhaled, a sweeping state of euphoria takes gentle hold of you body and mind. Immediately I began to feel my anxiety and stress wash away, not in a \"this feels good\" kind of way but in a one hundred percent, life is great kind of way. I get very inspired by this particular herb to pick up my guitar and write new music. I recommend this strain for anyone dealing with insomnia, as the later affects usually leave me ready for a full night of uninterrupted sleep. Note that I also mentioned \"Eczema\" in the Medical Conditions tab; my entire life I have suffered, and I mean that word in its purest form, from a condition called Dishydrotic Eczema. An excruciating skin ailment that causes me to tear violently at my arms, neck, face, scalp, legs, and trunk area.

It's a fine cross of Great white shark x northern lights x Dj shorts Blueberry, its a fairly new strain as of 2014. Upon first look this looks like some dank, big chunky frosty semi - dense nugs, minimal red hairs, maximum frostiness. The buds are top shelf quality, the grower has exceptional growing skills. So the bag appeal is great, now time to smoke... So i break off a nice chunk and load it into my pipe and take the lighter to it, and slowly inhale...  Upon exhale, the smoke is very smooth, the grower flushed this plant perfectly, the taste is a slight berryish, fruityish, ever so slight floral/earthyish, and nice skunky bite at the end.. think fruits mixed with a white widow type of flavor. The high settles in quickly, about 60 seconds after exhale you feel a swooshing feeling rush through your head and your body and your eyes drop low.. everything feels great, feeling like im on top of the world.. it feels so great it feels like it would make you forget about even the worst of pain and depression one could go through... I recommend this strain for anything and everything, its a great all around strain, daytime and night. It's also a great grower, and yeilder.

Makes you just appreciate everything around you. This is especially true about food! Never use without food around! I would also recommend not having it on a really full stomach since you'll still eat more, then just feel a little sick afterwards. However having it on an empty stomach is a bad idea as well since it will make you hungrier than you've ever been in your life.\nOverall though it's pretty incredible stuff when you just want to zone out and have a stress free few hours. As a university student I take it many times after exams when I just want to stop the thoughts in my head about questions I might have gotten wrong. It also makes sex, for my girlfriend especially (I would bet for most women it would have a greater positive effect but I'm aware that assumption is anecdotal), even better, much better. It makes us laugh about things we never otherwise find funny and makes us completely unafraid to express our love.\nI do however wear contacts so I see how dry eyes are a big deal with this strand.. luckily my eyes aren't sensitive but some friends of mine just immediately get blood shut red eyes so be aware of the possibility.\nTo summarize, I would absolutely recommend it for weekends and holidays or general downtime.

The high started with energy,euphoria, and relaxation combined with extremely disrupted time perception via changes in short term memory processing (time was not slowed down but when I spoke the memory of the sound of my voice lingered for an extended period of time- this lasted about an hour, and then the high changed into an almost narcotic and Sativa mix, which lasted around 3 hours.

Absolutely phenomenal in nearly every aspect. Top 5 strain all time for me.\n\nNow, to the characteristics.. The buds were absolutely covered in trichomes inside and out, nice to look at. The smell of this bud is simply amazing, it has a very strong blueberry smell and the taste is similar, but subdued a bit in comparison. The high is simply top notch, where awesome uplifting sativa effects mix with a calm relaxation make this strain one of the best. Medically, this strain is effective against anxiety, depression, and stress; I'm sure there are more, but that's what I use this strain for and it does a great job.\n\nSimply put, If you have a chance to try this strain - do so, you will not be disappointed.

The buds have a noticeable darker, earthier look and the smoke is pretty harsh on the lungs.\n\nThe reason I enjoy Afgoo so much is that it has the potency I'm looking for, but a nice happy, uplifting feeling to go along with it. This strain (like many quality indicas) is a stress-slayer. Anxiety, insomnia (for some), pain, and likely more that I do not know of. \n\nIn short, Afgoo is not only a great recreational smoke, it's quite a useful bud for medical use.

I'm not a cougher unless I take a massive pull, which I normally don't.\nI am not a heavy hitter and dabble in small amounts always.  Cannabis affects me easily and I can tell subtle differences between strains.\nThis stuff hit me immediately in the head.  My eyes tightened along with my forehead.  Unfortunately, I experienced a few minutes of anxiousness on the verge of paranoia which I didn't like at all.\nAfter about 3-4 normal hits from my chillum I decided that was enough for me.  I quickly retreated to my chair and got a movie fired up.  In about 5 minutes my anxiety started to leave me alone.  I was able to talk clearly but knew I could loose myself.  I let myself become involved in the movie.  45 minutes later and I was ready for bed.  My eyes were very tired and I knew I was ready to sleep.\nAfter brushing my teeth, I took a keen interest in the trees growing outside the bedroom window.  I'm guessing this could make for some pleasant summer evenings in the backyard.  I'd say everything was visually pleasing/interesting to me.\nThen it hit me.  I became exceptionally aroused.  I informed the wife but she was not on board.  This could be a sad ending to the night but alas, I remained chill, put my head down and quickly fell asleep.  The boy woke us up around 4:30 with his usual nightmare wake up call.  I was a bit tired this morning but I always am when the lad wakes us up, which is becoming a nightly thing now.  Grrr.\nI'd like to try this again tonight and enjoy it with the wife.  See if can have an even happier ending.","strain":"banana-kush","user":"Tuk","stars":"3","date":"5/21/2014 3:20 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Uplifted","Sleepy","Paranoid","Dry Eyes"],"ID":"159374"},{"_type":"dict","content":"The most exceptional relaxant to date.good for stress,pains,anxiety... and with 202-697 and 6328 you can get this very good weed","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"jassonj","stars":"4.5","date":"5/21/2014 3:33 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize"],"ID":"159375"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Man I only had like maybe a .7 of this shit one time and I was one of the best highs I've ever had!

It is supposed to be about %90 indic a yet it has sativa like growing properties with lateral branches and a total height of about 5 feet(indoors) growing under about 500 watts of LEDs. I also thought it would be a faster grow.  I'm approaching week 12(from seed) and the plants are only starting to have significant bud development.  It's a pretty large plant. I kept one of my plants relatively unpruned to see what it's natural development looked like. It's about 3-4 feet wide by 5 feet tall. All of the lower branches maintain a J shaped growth with the outer bud development reaching for the light. The one mistake I made with this plant was putting them into a 12-12 too early. At about 36\" and 6 weeks from seed, I changed the light cycle. Their was some leaf curling and probably the only period in which they didn't seem robustly healthy. They haven't had a really great nuts cycle either. I started them off on bud candy at about 4-6 weeks. And having been out of nuts for about 2 weeks, I just got some gen. hydro FloraBloom. \n If I let these plants grow to full maturity, they will be a cash cow. It already appears that the various buds growing on a stalk bare going to grow into each other. The unpruned plant has about 20-25 stalks which are developing buds. I was really surprised to see how well the led light penetrates the canopy. I'm not sure if that is because of the layout of lights or them being led. What I diid is, I kept a 300 watt full spectrum led about 6\" above the canopy from tyne start and once I started flowering, I introduced several 10 watt single chip LEDs on the walls at about waist height with their light being pointed at the lower branches. At like 8 weeks I added a 100 watt single chip led that i got on ebay for about $60 including the cost of a fan and heatsink. That is when I started  to notice that the bud growth is really evening out throughout the entire plants. \nThese ares the 1st plats that i HAVE GROWN WITH LED lights and I have been very happy with how they work.

As with many hybrids, a sativa-like head buzz ensued, followed by some slight, indica-like couch-locking, all over a 2-3 hour period. \nHowever, I shared a 2g blunt followed by a 2g double joint with two guys one night, and I was just gone. I had trouble walking back to my house (a five minute walk, mind you), then laid down on the driveway so I could trip some more, passed out and woke up two hours later, still f---ed up, and proceeded to trip quite a bit longer before ultimately falling asleep and waking up incredibly refreshed.\n\ntl;dr: mellow and heady with normal doses, but powerfully sedative (and quite fun) in higher doses.

Like, no joke, I've never been able to find a strain good/strong enough yet to do either, well enough. As far as how long the high lasts? I couldn't tell you. I've always ended up knocking out to sleep within about an hour of smoking. =P. LOL. It makes your eyelids heavy as Hell, you gotta really try to FIGHT to keep your eyes open, and yourself awake. As far as the pain, I find within 30 mins, almost all my pain is completely gone. I feel like I'm floating on a cloud of bliss. :). Had flowers, smoked out of a water bong with tons of ice cubes, and also vaped out of an Iolite. I've found smoking out of the bong first, then vaping a couple bowls after, is complete perfection. While vaping, there's a very subtle sweet aroma and taste. Very delicious. Mysterious. More of a head high while vaping. And more of a body high from the bong. Def the happiest, most fun/peaceful high ever. Ultimate favorite. Relaxing. In fact, I had no idea it was possible to feel this relaxed. As an example, I have very high hypertension from stress. My usual blood pressure is anywhere from 160 - 170 over 85 - 99 normally. Smoking other strains, I've gotten it down to like 139 - 150 over 80 - 85. Yesterday, I took my blood pressure about 45 mins from vaping a couple bowls, and it was 118/70. I was almost scared!! LOL. So, it works well for stress, anxiety, hypertension, etc. Couchlocker.

We smoked it all taking bong rips, my two buddies even threw up and no thats not a bad thing. Usually when i would smoke a lot, A LOT i'd be weary but I was feeling exceptionally well. Craziest moment for was i was sitting back looking off into space where suddenly i was looking back at my self, it felt and appeared as if i were looking at myself from slightly above but shortly scared myself straight but it was an incredible high moment, it was a beautiful high. At the end of the night we loaded our last few bowls and rolled up a joint it felt like a stand off of who would crack first, I looked over at my buddy and no joke he looked so much like one of those people from those weed commercials back in the day where the person would deflate and be sitting flat out, it was insane. Oh yeah and we were hot boxing a shed in my back yard good size enough so that we could all fit comfortably. Afterwards we all went out and the smoke was flowing out for  about 15 or so minutes.

I find that this is a good go to for people who are stressed, upset, angry, depressed and particularly for insomnia. Otherwise it's also pretty nice for relaxing after work with a movie, but the one issue I consistently run into with it is the regular crash about 1.5 hours in. I get this crappy feeling feeling in my face (pressure at the bridge of the nose, heavy eyelids, etc), and find it hard to focus on anything. I have no motivation to do anything and usually end up just passing out for a bit. Day time smoking is a bit better, but I still usually feel the need to take a nap. It differs from a regular couch-lock in that it's very groggy rather than just super-relaxed.\n\nI've tried combatting this issue with caffeine to no avail. It keeps me awake longer, but I still feel bored and groggy towards the end. Don't get me wrong, it's not really an unpleasant feeling, just disappointing for someone wanting something more uplifting and arousing.\n\nBased upon this experience, I'd say it's excellent for medicinal purposes, particularly for those involving psychological illnesses (depression, burn-out, anxiety). For recreational purposes, it's fine for social events that keep your attention, but for lone smoking you'll just pass out within an hour or two.\n\nNote: I am certain I had legitimate quality White Rhino, as it was medical from a dispensery .","strain":"white-rhino","user":"GetOutOfBox","stars":"3","date":"5/31/2014 5:31 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Hungry","Sleepy","Relaxed","Happy","Tingly","Paranoid","Pine","Menthol","Sage"],"ID":"162206"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Migraine pain 4-5; nausea 6-7 when I medicated round 1800? or so.

Granted, I'm not stoned but I definitely got a \"head tap.\" The flavor itself, based on the first hit, was an abundant diesel. The second hit brought on a subtle piney/mint taste. But I can't quite out my finger on it. The third hit came with even more confusion. As I take my next (insert pause here), I am overwhelmed with a \"chemical\" taste. I hate to use chemical as a flavor, seeing as it's such a general term, but that's what i get. Overall, the flavor is abundantly chemical with undertones of pine and ammonia saturated in \"sweet\" diesel (sweet as in flavor, not \"awesome dude!\"). At this point I'm about 6 or 7 dabs in. Normally I would be high by now, but aside from the initial buzz, sad to say I'm just okay...... Now I'm at 10 or so, having taken several hits in rapid succession. This is a great high! I have literally become stupid. It's taken me about five minutes to write the last two sentences, not because I didn't know what to say, but because I couldn't stop staring at the screen. I mean, just staring. The only downside is how much I had to smoke in order to get to this point. As it seems to be leveling out as well. But needless to say, effective communication and Dead Head OG don't compliment one another........... Okay, now that I'm back :) From a medicinal point of view I tried Dh to relieve my back pain. From a one to ten scale I was at a four, nothing serious. I can honestly say the pain subsided, and if anything it simply dulled the pain. But I do have a slight headache, almost as if I'm crashing from the high. Or I might need to drink some water. Overall this is a nice strain. The high is fantastic, euphoric and tranquil. If only it didn't take so much to get there. Medicinally, it dulls slight pain and loosens (joints) you up. But risks include a slight, short lived headache. \nThanks for reading and I hope this helps you make an informed choice.

On a side note, Aretha gets me every time. \nThe first hit had two prominent flavors, a sweet citrus with a hint of pine. Granted I was distracted by the film so I did not concentrate enough to really pull out the flavors. The next few dabs delivered the same result. Seems to be consistent flavor.... delicious. \nThe first few hits, without a doubt, got me buzzed and I felt immediate relief of my arthritis symptoms (joints in fingers). There is not much more I can say in terms of medicinal use. The arthritis is the only thing I am experiencing at this time.....\nDab #4: This particular hit got me. I overdid this one and took a rather large dab. Right away I experienced flushing and briefly broke a sweat (few seconds). \nIn terms of the high, it is very subtle. I am high, but without the negative mental effects. I am able to focus and my thoughts are clear. I would feel comfortable in any social or professional situation. On the flip side, the coughing has given me a scratchy throat. But at the same time it serves me right for taking such a big hit....... excuse me for a moment, I need to shake my tail feather....                                                                                          Dab #7: An average to medium size hit. This hit introduced some spice to the citrus, but it still had it's sweetness. I suppose the spice and the pine compliment each other. \nI have to say, this is a fantastic strain all around. The flavor is robust with very nice complimenting tastes within. The high is excellent; it's happy, energetic, and just simply makes you feel good. I would strongly recommend for day time use. The medicinal properties seem to be active in this strain as well. Mind you, the only symptom I was experiencing at the time of this review was arthritis in my fingers. I achieved immediate relief. \nThanks for reading this review, I hope this helps you make an informed choice....","strain":"jillybean","user":"Ohdontyaknow","stars":"4.5","date":"6/1/2014 4:22 PM","attributes":["Concentrate ","Creative","Focused","Happy","Energetic","Citrus","Sweet","Pine","Spicy/Herbal"],"ID":"162366"},{"_type":"dict","content":"2","strain":"charlottes-web","user":"mswayze","stars":"0","date":"6/1/2014 3:08 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"162365"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Very good I have chronic muscle spasms and this is a great strain.

The genetics to my knowledge are Og Kush x (Grandaddy Purple x Durban) x Cherry - which turns what was maybe 1/3 sativa into more like 1/6 sativa - making this a heavily indica dominant variation of Girl Scout Cookies.  Having grown this myself you know when you have the real Thin Mint Cut - aesthetically it is unmistakeable - deep deep green-brown hues with almost burnt orange hairs and occasional purple hues if grown cold, it looks and smells like no other strain. The shade of brown is very distinctive and deep almost like mahogany. if cured properly for 3 or 4 weeks the smell of mint really does come out, and an unmistakeable coffee smell.  I consider this to be a strain for people who are really into the bouquet aspect, the smell and appearance, because they are beautiful.  As for the effect, I use it to fall asleep.  It does nothing but make me tired, whereas the original Girl Scout Cookies were much more stimulating as the Durban was more prevalent.

I went with a friend to see X-men and we were being silly on the way to the theater, but when when the movie started we were able to relax and enjoy the movie w/o feeling super stoned.  Did a little more before we had dinner after and I was cracking up so hard I had to stand up from my chair so that I did not fall out of it.  If you want to go on a little adventure through the city/town I would recommend it.","strain":"dutch-treat","user":"sdmike81","stars":"4","date":"6/5/2014 4:57 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Uplifted","Relaxed","Giggly"],"ID":"163606"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Better than most but shouldn't be a host.

I am having some trouble trying to pinpoint exactly what it is. My initial reaction  was peach, but it wasn't overwhelming. Possibly apricot, but to be honest I don't eat enough of them to know the difference. But if you take a decent hit, and close your eyes as you exhale slowly, you can truly begin to taste what this strain has to offer. The best way I can describe this taste would be to say it's like eating a green apple jolly rancher with a pink starbust..... tested. And for a brief moment you can picture a ball of cotton candy. But sad to say, it does not come with the sweetness of such a combination. There is an off flavor in there that keeps this strain humble. Pungent, in this case, is an excellent adjective. \nNow for most important part. In terms of the high, not so much. Yeah, I've got a buzz, but that's all it is. As far as medicinal value, about the same. It's provided some arthritis relief, but personally I wouldn't consider this a go to. I can not speak for other symptoms or conditions at this particular time. Luckily I'm only experiencing inflammation at the moment. \nIf you want a strain for flavor, this is a good choice. Just be sure you've got a solid palate or you will miss out on the subtle, \"hidden\" flavors. Personally, the cookies aren't doing much for me in terms of the high. I just powered through about ten dabs and I'm still just buzzing. I will say that I am relaxed. So it's got that going for it.... or maybe I should cut back. \n........Hope this helps you make an informed choice.","strain":"girl-scout-cookie","user":"Ohdontyaknow","stars":"3","date":"6/8/2014 2:35 AM","attributes":["Concentrate ","Relaxed","Tree Fruit","Peach","Apple","Pungent"],"ID":"164606"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"white-rhino","user":"Cdustin12","stars":"4","date":"6/8/2014 2:44 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Giggly","Happy","Uplifted","Relaxed"],"ID":"164607"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This strain was excellent in regards to potency, and the high was very long lasting, but it was too heavy for me.

I recommend it for the relief of nausea, insomnia, insomnia, chronic pain, stress, and as an appetite stimulant.

It is a sativa dominant plant.  It seemed slightly more susceptible to root rot during very hot weather.  Resist the temptation to overwater during heat.  Use shade instead, if possible and keep root oxygen up.  \n\nThis was a tall, sort of rangy plant, not as pretty as some, but with a great flexibility.  It stood up during 107 days with 20 mph winds.  Staking highly recommended anyway.  \n\nAgent Orange reveals its power after it is cut.  During the curing and trimming, there is a very strong almost industrial orange fragrance.  It makes you think your house is clean, but, not.  It has a bud that is a little smaller than an indica strain, but well clad in orange hairs.  As it matures the hairs become silvered with resin droplets.  I harvested on the third consecutive day after nights dropped below 68.  A little bit of chill is a nice ripener.  \n\nOnce trimmed and tasted, Agent Orange immediately went on my list to grow again.  It held up well outside, produced a very respectable amount of prime cuts as well as almost another pound in a second cut of lower, less mature foliage.  It has a definite citrusy taste and smell.  You could imagine it having been cured with orange rind or something, but it is what it is.  Used in a vape, it expands the lungs, and does something very confusing to the brain.  Immediately.  For a while.  It is great for cerebral thought and those stargazing summer evenings or nights in front of the fire.  Great strain, already got another round of it in.

This is a true hybrid as I noticed both Indica and Sativa properties. The flowers are a light yellow/green mixed with medium green and light brown hairs. to me, it looks a lot like Pineapple Express. This sample from River City in PDX is sticky with resin and the smell is fantastic. Probably the sweetest and most reminiscent of fruit of any strain I've tried (out of dozens). The smell carries through to the taste. Vaping the flower produced several bags of thick vapor that made me cough a couple of times. The effects took about 10 minutes to be substantially noticeable for me, but when it hit, it was fairly intense euphoria mixed with calm. I was able to think clearly for the first half hour with this strain, then the munchies hit with a vengeance. I say vengeance, because I suffer with nausea problems, and too high a munchie factor can sometimes increase my nausea by kicking my stomach into overdrive. This is one of those strains. It would be great for someone who has appetite problems but doesn't deal with nausea issues. The kush effects kicked in after a snack and made me really sleepily and thick brained but really relaxed for about an hour. I was able to power through the grogginess and brain fog and am writing this review on the other side. Overall, this strain has several outstanding qualities. This smell and the favor alone make this a stand out. I recommend this strain if you want intense munchies, but you might want to get the munchies out first as there was a longish cough lock phase as well. No anxiety or paranoia for me with this strain. About a two hour migrating overall effect. Relaxing for both mind and body. I will definitely get this strain again when I can. -sy","strain":"strawberry-banana","user":"u420","stars":"4","date":"6/13/2014 5:31 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Euphoric","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Uplifted"],"ID":"165417"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This strain, I feel, has always been underrated.

This is a true hybrid as I noticed both Indica and Sativa properties. The flowers are a light yellow/green mixed with medium green and light brown hairs. to me, it looks a lot like Pineapple Express. This sample from River City in PDX is sticky with resin and the smell is fantastic. Probably the sweetest and most reminiscent of fruit of any strain I've tried (out of dozens). The smell carries through to the taste. Vaping the flower produced several bags of thick vapor that made me cough a couple of times. The effects took about 10 minutes to be substantially noticeable for me, but when it hit, it was fairly intense euphoria mixed with calm. I was able to think clearly for the first half hour with this strain, then the munchies hit with a vengeance. I say vengeance, because I suffer with nausea problems, and too high a munchie factor can sometimes increase my nausea by kicking my stomach into overdrive. This is one of those strains. It would be great for someone who has appetite problems but doesn't deal with nausea issues. The kush effects kicked in after a snack and made me really sleepily and thick brained but really relaxed for about an hour. I was able to power through the grogginess and brain fog and am writing this review on the other side. Overall, this strain has several outstanding qualities. This smell and the favor alone make this a stand out. I recommend this strain if you want intense munchies, but you might want to get the munchies out first as there was a longish cough lock phase as well. No anxiety or paranoia for me with this strain. About a two hour migrating overall effect. Relaxing for both mind and body. I will definitely get this strain again when I can. -sy","strain":"strawberry-banana","user":"u420","stars":"4","date":"6/13/2014 5:27 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Euphoric","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Uplifted"],"ID":"165588"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Grapefruit kush is a nice relaxed high that can come with its negative effects such as dry mouth and paranoia but other than that it's generally nice bud","strain":"grapefruit-kush","user":"toker420420","stars":"3","date":"6/13/2014 10:52 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Paranoid","Relaxed","Uplifted","Hungry","Talkative","Sleepy","Giggly","Aroused"],"ID":"165586"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"ghost-train-haze","user":"Armacon","stars":"5","date":"6/13/2014 2:15 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Giggly","Focused","Euphoric","Talkative","Energetic","Paranoid","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth","Sweet","Citrus","Tropical","Pungent","Butter","Pine"],"ID":"165587"},{"_type":"dict","content":"A medium-bodied Sativa with a fair amount of trichomes and amber pistils .

Every girl I've smoked it with, their skirts were visibly wet the moment they smelt it, with their panties dropped after the first bowl.

An old shaman told me, that Shiva's female counter part Parvati, became boring to her husband who'd been slipping into the seductive hands of nymphs. (These hoes ain't loyal)... So, Parvati cried, and from her tears birthed ganja. Parvati introduced her new creation with Shiva, who smoked it with her. Shiva's third eye immediately opened, seeing the beauty inside Parvati and all aspects of her mind, body and soul. He became aroused, and forgot about the nymphs (hoes), and made love to Parvati instead. Since then, Ganja has been used by many as an aphrodisiac, created by Parvati to combine two lovers in calming unity.","strain":"orange-velvet","user":"TallOrange","stars":"5","date":"6/15/2014 12:37 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Aroused","Euphoric","Energetic","Creative","Giggly","Happy","Relaxed","Talkative","Tingly","Uplifted","Anxious","Orange","Sweet"],"ID":"165851"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This is a beautiful strain.

Vaping the flower produced a medium vapor. No urge to cough at all. The effects hit after about five minutes with a focused but relaxed feeling. Not a couch lock strain at all. Activities are more pleasant with this strain. Colors and sounds are more vibrant and alive. Probably good for listening to music or watching a movie. For me,  I could use it before doing almost any activity, so it would probably be good for a new patient. Not really effective for muscle spasms or pain control other than from distraction. Very little munchie factor, at least for the first hour. Although it didn't increase my nausea, it didn't make me want to eat either.  Not sure if that's good or bad.

I was sitting around a fire pit and the fire roared to life, the flames got hotter, the color got more intense orange, and I sunk miles deep into my chair. I couldn't believe what I was feeling and got the giggles for 5 mins. Then looked up at the starry night and my mind felt it had floated off into space and stayed high up there the rest of the night.

It's 12 hours later, the next day and I'm still feeling a constant sense of peace and calm. This strain is definitely appropriate for anxiety but only if you are in a good mood prior. Otherwise, it could have the opposite effect and trigger a panic attack. It's better to use this strain as a nightly dose to keep you level throughout the day instead of lighting up when the anxiety comes because then it's positive effects diminish and the negative ones become that much more obvious.

The high is 99% head high leaving the body not glued to anything meaning a more energetic and adventurous feel. Euphoria and happiness are strong, but not too overpowering, just like most traits for this strain. Creativity flows faster and meditating with Maui Waui is much more spiritual. Time seems to slow, colors become more vivid, moments are in slower motion and leave faded trails behind, trees create colorful auras of energy around them, and the more dream-like feel becomes more and more present. This strain is perfect for a day out and about or under the sun and even great for exercising and exploring.

Helps me get to sleep when I am winding down AND keeps me asleep, but when I am awake I smoked after a couple cups of coffee and was leveled out and able to keep focused and on task. \n\nThis strand also made me super snacky- not hungry but wanting to snack. Smoked a couple hours after a hearty dinner and wanted more food! So keep whatever snacks you enjoy on hand- if you're trying to eat healthy don't have ANY shitty food around- you'll find it! Haha!\n\nThis also gave me crazy dreams! Just incredibly vivid, drawn out, and fun. Nothing scary or intense, just those dreams you want to sleep on and keep having. This is my favorite aspect of insomnia-preventing strands; the deep sleep with addition of fun, memorable dreams:-) \n\nMild paranoia for me. My partner also experienced some paranoia, slightly more then me.\n\nI don't really care about taste or smell. The smell was strong- could be easily smelled through the bag, and it tasted like marijuana. Sorry.\n\nI would recommend this most for chilling out and going to bed.

Just the right amount of harshness.  \n\nExperience: The flavors are subtle but they creep up.  Within 10 seconds I have the tingly feeling when I breathe in and out.  The high is mellow, relaxed, and productive (especially for an Indica, though this is somewhat of a hybrid).  Creativity and euphoria are the highlights.  It's not an overbearing, mind-bending high, more peaceful and subtle.  Over time, the focused effect is dominated by the relaxing all-body high.  The munchies are not overwhelming, nor is the need to sleep, however one certainly could benefit from ingesting Griffin if suffering from insomnia.   \n\nAll around I would definitely recommend this to my friends for a relaxed, social, productive high followed by a very mellow and relaxing come-down.","strain":"4579a8ef-e471-4479-b392-193464165a4b","user":"SuperKarma","stars":"4","date":"6/23/2014 3:55 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Relaxed","Uplifted","Focused","Creative","Grape","Pine","Sweet"],"ID":"168618"},{"_type":"dict","content":"My new favorite.

Very dark and \"ashy\" flavor.\n\nFor me, this one is definitely best suited for night time, when you have done all the things you needed to do. Very heavy feeling of couchlock, relaxation, and sedation. My mind remains very active, creative, and introspective...but physically it is a very heavy relaxation. I've smoked/vaped it a few times during the day, and it was just too much to be able to get things done.\n\nIn summary, it's a great solo night-burn.

The perfect amount smoked will enhance any situation.\nIt could be on a nice sunny afternoon. Bring some speakers, snacks, sunglasses, a swimsuit, and your bros. Beverages too. Chill out by the river and hit a fat jonny with your friends. Enjoy the sun and also relax in the river. The sense of touch and feel is definitely enhanced with some AK. Smoke too much though and you'll go all numb. Music is a priority when smoking AK-47. Some up lifting or happy music rather than sad. It generates the mood for sure. \nOr it could be on a late night hang out session. Find a place outdoors and quiet, where u can enjoy people company, everyone will be down to smoke some. Then go home and immediately fall asleep. \nOr it could be right before a long and boring day of traveling, whether car, train, or plane. Make everything a bit more interesting and maybe even less hectic with some this strain. \nOr if you are alone and just want to go full retard, staying glued to your couch all day, then smoke a lot of it. Thats general for most weed though.\nDepending on the situation AK-47 will leave you indulging in the common attributes of a Indica or Sativa, which is classic for a Hybrid strain. I recommend just smoking one joint and experiencing it instead of worrying about what effect it will have. From my experience I'd say it's best for hangouts. \nIT'S TOP!","strain":"ak-47","user":"simon14415","stars":"4","date":"6/26/2014 8:40 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Happy","Euphoric","Dry Eyes","Skunk","Pine","Grape"],"ID":"170144"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Loved the smell and taste.

And don't breathe in for about 5 seconds or you get a nice lungful of burning mist. Why they had to use ethanol as a base is beyond me. Could they not use a vegetable oil and dropper instead of alcohol and a spray bottle? Apparently one of the things GW Pharmaceuticals is so proud of is their delivery system which promises exactly 100µL per spray.  I guess that's why I only got 89 doses out of my $257 bottle. At 6-8 doses per day, that can get expensive quickly. I calculated the THC/CBD percentages from the fact that alcohol weighs .789 times water and the stated doses are 2.5mg/mL THC and 2.7mg/mL CBD.  I may be a decimal point or two off if it is not 100% pure alcohol but they are very close and, as you can deduct, do not lead to a very good medicinal form of marijuana. The effects start, after the burning ouchiness, with slight dizziness and alertness which, after about 1/2 an hour devolve into a very uncomfortable state where you are relaxed and sleepy but totally unable to fall asleep. It's a tiny bit torturous, so I learned to stop about 6pm if you want to fall asleep the same day. On the good side, those of us who suffer from fidgeting from Gravol, rather than somnolence, Sativex does get rid of the running leg syndrome and allow us to use it as a sleep aid. But hell, there are strains of weed that take you to neverland quickly and they don't add a cacophony of unpleasant side effects. Sativex does have some plusses: it does deal with chronic pain relatively well for short periods of time (hence the need to use it often), does give you a sense of hunger, which, if you have gastrointestinal disorders, you may not recognize as hunger... just more pain. It's hunger... after a 1/2 pound veggie burger, fries and 4 glasses of root beer, the \"pain\" goes away. Very strange. =) The nausea I feel has been controlled rather well by Ondansetron, an anti-emetic for cancer patients, but I didn't need it at all on Sativex. It works very well for that. Oh, and it makes you horny.

Smoke too much though and you'll go all numb. Music is a priority when smoking AK-47. Some up lifting or happy music rather than sad. It generates the mood for sure. \nOr it could be on a late night hang out session. Find a place outdoors and quiet, where u can enjoy people company, everyone will be down to smoke some. Then go home and immediately fall asleep. \nOr it could be right before a long and boring day of traveling, whether car, train, or plane. Make everything a bit more interesting and maybe even less hectic with some this strain. \nOr if you are alone and just want to go full retard, staying glued to your couch all day, then smoke a lot of it. Thats general for most weed though.\nDepending on the situation AK-47 will leave you indulging in the common attributes of a Indica or Sativa, which is classic for a Hybrid strain. I recommend just smoking one joint and experiencing it instead of worrying about what effect it will have.

He said he had encounter nothing better for the muscle pain and spasms. The RSO is tested at about 35% THC and 13.5% CBD. No wonder it's good for muscles spasms and nerve problems with that kind of CBD content. Last night, after putting way more stress on my back than I should have, I put about 200mg of the RSO into a gel cap (stuff tastes nasty), and swallowed it. About an hour and a half later, I began experiencing a very physically relaxed feeling that spread to my mental processes. This is not for day time - I would only take this at night when I want to mellow at home for a couple of hours, then sleep. Went to bed about an hour after the first effects, fell asleep within a half hour (amazing) and slept for eight and a half hours straight (almost unprecedented). Today, I am still relaxed and a little groggy but not unmanageably so. This stuff did exactly what I needed it to. This will be my go-to whenever I feel muscle spasms or pain like that again.

The flavour was fantastic; really organic, floral, and earthy tasting. I went inside and made myself a green tea, and by the time I made it to my computer I was feeling a major cerebral high. I had not experienced a clean and significant high like this in a long time.\n\nI felt very talkative, happy, uplifting, and creative.

There is also a hint of pine throughout the after taste which could possibly be the cause of the soap flavor. It is important to note that the soap flavor is not overwhelming, if anything it is very subtle. The most overwhelming flavor is diesel/chem taste. \nThe high is a relaxed, meditative state of couch lock.

Alaskan Thunder Fuck (ATF) is listed as a Sativa and Matanuska Thunder Fuck (MTF) is listed as a hybrid. Matanuska Thunder Fuck is named after the Matanuska-Susitna Valley in Alaska, about 50 miles outside of Anchorage, which is revered for rich volcanic soil and it's intense summer growing season. I lived in the Mat-Su valley in the late 70s, early 80s when this strain was being fine tuned. The strain came out of a blend of a number of different landrace strains that were folded into the most popular strains in the area at the time. Emphases was placed on strains that didn't grow too high (for cramped quarters) and that had a short flowering cycle to optimize for the short summer. The best strain (in my opinion) to come out of this process, became known as Thunder Fuck or just Thunder to people in the valley and Matanuska Thunder Fuck to people in places in Alaska outside the Mat-Su valley. There were a couple of strains that had such similar genetics that they were collectively known as MTF and it was almost impossible to tell the difference. I know there were some MTF seeds and cuttings exported to the Pacific Northwest during that time because I spoke to a WA grower, visiting Alaska and he was growing out an MTF plant at that time. Cannabis was recriminalized in the mid 80s in Alaska and the strain went underground when the DEA stepped up enforcement and true (or even close) MTF is difficult to find now, even in Alaska. True MTF is a hybrid strain that leans slightly on the Indica side. The plants tend to grow short and thick, at least in Alaska and especially with good cropping. The flowers are a blend of dark and medium green with reddish brown hairs, and a structure similar to a Kush but with smaller buds. MTF doesn't normally turn purple hues unless it's finished outside toward the end of the summer in northern climates. The scent is a strong skunky piney smell, with mint undertones that most containers can't contain. The effects are pretty unique in that they start with a very strong Sativa type high, very spacey and euphoric, then migrates after a while into a very relaxed couch lock, Indica phase. There are often giggly and/or aroused phases to the experience as well. Beware of intense munchies with this strain. Sleep is usually easy with MTF but unless you use too much, it doesn't usually force sleep. It is a fantastic pain killer and muscle relaxer. MTF was developed by Alaskans to get through the long winter months but also to take advantage of epic summer days. True MTF is unquestionably my favorite strain of all time. \n\"Alaskan\" Thunder Fuck (ATF) is NOT the same thing. I've sampled several examples of the Pacific Northwest ATF as well as a strain called Oregon TF that are all very similar to each other. They are all sativa dominant with classic sativa bud structure. They had none of the Indica effects that I enjoyed so much in MTF. This is also not the Tundra strain that Leafly refers to as an alternative name to MTF. Tundra is yet another type of strain, that in my experience is similar to NL#5 and now appears to be extinct in its original form. \nSince I've become a medical user, I've only found two examples of MTF that I consider close to being genuine. Pure Oregon is the only place in Portland I've found MTF, that's close enough to satisfy my high standards for this strain. If you are looking for an intense but balanced hybrid this one is worth a try if you can find it.","strain":"matanuska-thunder-fuck","user":"u420","stars":"5","date":"7/3/2014 8:24 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Aroused","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Talkative","Uplifted","Dry Mouth","Dry Eyes"],"ID":"171742"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I love this strain it was actually the 1st that I ever got more than a little buzz off of I would highly recommend this strain.","strain":"california-orange","user":"YagiBoi3","stars":"5","date":"7/3/2014 12:58 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Talkative","Citrus","Orange","Mint"],"ID":"171743"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I like the taste a lot. the effect was largely hyped in my opinion. good sativa effect but I suffer from extreme pain and it was no help","strain":"thin-mint","user":"silentog","stars":"3","date":"7/3/2014 2:35 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Giggly","Talkative","Uplifted","Spicy/Herbal","Minty","Mint"],"ID":"171744"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"white-rhino","user":"lccw","stars":"2.5","date":"7/3/2014 3:53 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Hungry","Dizzy","Dry Mouth","Headache","Paranoid","Anxious"],"ID":"171745"},{"_type":"dict","content":"one of the best tasting strains out there. fruity with a hint of earthy tobacco.

I have bipolar II, and my other medication helps my mood to be stable, but what I still struggle with are light bouts of depression. Well here's where Romulan really does great work.  It's very unique in its ability to keep me calm and relax.  There's definitely no sense of the in-your-head, anxiety/paranoid, feeling that some people, including me, dislike about certain strains.\n\nAlong with the relaxation, there's a subtle uplifting feeling, it can bring me to a sort of zen-like state, so long as that includes hunger.  So for light to mild depression, I would recommend this strain.\n\nWhile you may feel relaxed and have a desire to stay in bed, there's little to no traces of any sort of couch-lock.

Average lasting high.\n\nOverall, a good sativa, not too strong.

I am still new to smoking but out of the 10 other strains I have tried...nothing comes close to this one!!!  \n\nIn LA, you can buy this or another strain called \"The Hulk\" which is the same thing just from different growers. It's a little hard to find in LA but California Compassionate Care Network in North Hollywood sell BOTH kinds which is great!\n\nI smoke because I am bipolar and I have crazy depression. I am still new to the smoking weed and only started as an alternative to taking chemical medicine.  At the most, I smoke once a week...mainly when I feel a manic attack coming on or to lift my depression....just fyi.\n\nI am allergic to stativa (makes me throw up...every time...) but here is why this strain is THE BEST. My body feels like a heavy indica by the way I feel so relaxed...like I'm getting a massage...but my mind feels sharp and on point while having a huge body high.  I just remember saying \"I feel so amazing\" all through out the night. Also, this strain did not make me sleepy despite feeling so relaxed. While high, I played cards with friends who were sober and had no clue I was high. Mentally I felt so happy and excited. \n\nAnother reason why I like this strain so much is because it is almost a perfect mix of Girl Scout Cookies and Platinum Bubba.  Girl Scout Cookies is a very sharp focused, euphoric, clear headed indica while Platinum Bubba has a lot of the body high effects where everything sounds AMAZING and everything you see is almost as if you are seeing it for the first time.  I always thought with weed you only had an either/or choice but with Louis XIII, you get both which is AWESOME!  I don't feel super baked when high on Louis....rather very much myself in functionality and comprehension.  I used to use Girl Scout Cookies for daytime medication and Platinum Bubba for night but now I can just use Louis XIII and have the best of both worlds for anytime.  \n\nThe high lasts for days too.  Mentally I felt so at peace and normal the following days. This strain is AMAZING for people who suffer from mental illness, ADD or physical pain.  I also get extremely creative when on it and laugh...but in a controlled way to not seem weird or high.  Little to no paranoia. Also created a lot of arousal....more than any other strain I have tried (and it lasted for a few days too!).  Dry mouth FOR SURE but other than that, this would be my all time favorite strain which I plan on being my go-to from now on.\n\nI am writing this much because I want to help other people like me who are in that trial and error process of finding the right strain.

It's alot to handle, especially if you consume around a half-gram on your first day with it, and the high is extremely potent. I should mention that I'm also a low-tolerance freshie, learning the ropes & leaves.\n\nVaping it gave me a more mellow, rolled intro. I began by noticing its ability to numb pain in a wave of cool, refreshing relief. There was also the feeling of a great, invigorating buzz, and around this point I'd experienced a 0.1g intake.\n\nWhat caught me off guard was the strength of the mind-high. While it starts off comfortably balanced between the body & mind, a dozen minutes in and I could begin to feel my vision going into this really trippy place - I took in the world around me more like a stop-motion movie than anything.\n\nAt this point my intake level was already 0.5g, but the vape's buildup had me at a 0.2-0.3 level. I was preferably chair-locked by this point but I could absolutely get up and move. It's an interesting effect - it feels almost as if you were sober on the outside and clay-oven baked on the inside.\n\nA friend and I decided to head out and hit up a McDonald's -- it was a bit of a mission. The strain doesn't make you sleepy, it simply slows down your vision (at least for me). Your high mind can't comprehend it but your body can, and you need to go into a sort of autopilot in order to make the walk. Not to worry tho, you won't be in a dangerous position, just uber-smashed. You'll look completely sober to anyone public, unless you've left the solar system by this point ;)\n\nWhen you deal with people at this level its definitely possible to converse - you can & will remember things like what your crew would like to order, etc. You'll be in a tough place though, because the effects are very disconcerting and potentially anxiety-inducing if you get uncomfortable.\n\nGood luck -- remember to breathe & walk into this High-THC monster, not run.

Per label: 18.06% total THC, .01% total CBD, harvested 6/23/14.\n\nFirst things first, this stuff is STINKY.  It's a great aroma, but if you don't want your entire house to reek, you better wrap this up and put it in some tightly, but TIGHTLY closed container!  \n\nNow down to business.  Full disclosure:  Former daily consumer who hasn't consumed in ten years, when I stopped indefinitely and decided I was going to hold out for legalization no matter how long it took.  And finally, that time has arrived!  So this review is as a former high tolerance smoker after many years dry.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here, so maybe this review will be helpful to someone!\n\nI had to make some notes along the way last night so I'd be able to write something accurate!  I took a tiny hit off of a medium size pipe.  It was smooth, solid, familiar taste.  Let that sink in and took a slightly larger hit.  I started to feel it, in my eyes first.\n\nFive minutes from the first hit I was starting to feel it full-on; I took one more decent size hit, still smooth, no coughing.  At that point I was perfectly high.  My body felt like gravity just doubled, but my mind was taking in my surroundings and evaluating the effects my body was experiencing. I was sitting outside in the 80 degree evening enjoying the peace, letting my thoughts wander.  A couple hours later I ended up in the house and feeling like it was time to find some tv.  Unfortunately after trying some of my current faves and my old standbys nothing meshed with my high, so I settled on music videos and that agreed with my state of mind.  I took one more big hit which did make me choke and cough a bit, oh well! \n\nAfter that it was one hundred percent munchies and on-my-assness.  If anyone else had been here with me, it would have been one of those silent hangouts.  I could not have held up much conversation.  I hit the wrong button on the Roku about three times in a row trying to get to a different menu - ha!  When I went to bed, I slept great - and for eleven hours...\n\nThe indica in this strain hit me hard.  It also took about ten years of stress off me and I felt great when I woke up.  The high was quality, and I did not even smoke an entire bowl.  I think that even back when I was a regular smoker I would have been pretty high with a relatively small amount, but maybe it wouldn't have lasted as long - hard to know!\n\nI would happily smoke this again, when I have hours free to do nothing or in a small quantity at bedtime if I was having trouble sleeping.  I wouldn't use it as a daytime smoke unless I needed a full day's vacation.  A great smoke for listening to music.  I thought I might go for a walk, but once it hit me, that was out of the question.  Walking to the kitchen was an effort and due to the munchies I had to make that journey repeatedly - heh, heh.  The only thing that wasn't quite perfect for me was that my mind didn't quite match where my body was at - my thoughts were wandering too much.  When my body's that shut down I like my mind to be able to lock down on things too, but I was a bit bored in my head, a bit impatient.  I didn't want to smoke more after that last hit because I already felt like I couldn't move.  \n\nI would say that anyone who's been out of the smokestream for a long time and wants the experience of being really stoned will be extremely happy with this strain.  Those who like a more active or cerebral high will probably be looking to something different.   \n\nSatisfied customer!","strain":"sour-kush","user":"despejada","stars":"4.5","date":"7/12/2014 11:19 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Tingly","Pungent"],"ID":"176624"},{"_type":"dict","content":"  \n ","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"SuperZig","stars":"0","date":"7/13/2014 12:24 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"176625"},{"_type":"dict","content":"A lot of my friends, which are strictly Sativa users loved this Indica-dominant strain!
