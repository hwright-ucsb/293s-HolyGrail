Try jarring the nugs with a lemon peel for a few days, it will taste like earthy lemonade :) This ganj makes me clear-headed, genuinely happy, creative, and inspired. I recommend this to anybody, but especially if you've ever smoked some weed that made you too hungry, tired, paranoid, sick, or otherwise not as chill as you wanted to be, try this. Smoking once may not be enough of a high for some. If you're like that, which is how I am, wait a little while and smoke a second time. You'll be ready to take on the world. A great daytime smoke fa sho. If you'd like to have similar effects but be more giggly and be left potentially ready to fall asleep, I recommend checking out Jamaican Pearl.

My review is for Harle Tsu #16 sold by a local dispensary displaying a lab report indicating 11% CBD and 5% THC. So for this strain I disagree with the current Leafly description \"without psychoactivity\" since the 20:1 description is only for an unusual strain variant. I definitely had a strong and full high, but it was somewhat different from a usual THC high (I am unable to verbally describe that difference).  Harle Tsu #16 is certainly quite psychoactive and furnished a very mellow after-high, which makes sense, since inhaled CBD reportedly has a half-life longer than 24 hours, far beyond the THC half-life.\n\nIn my opinion, Harle-Tsu is a stupid-sounding name; NamiQuin would have sounded cooler and cuter.\n\nStill, the question that health-conscious cannabis users must ask themselves these days: Since so many health benefits are associated with CBD, is there any good reason why a high-CBD strain  (or at least 1:1) should not be used instead of (or alongside) a \"normal\" high-THC strain?","strain":"harle-tsu","user":"ThatToo","stars":"4","date":"7/15/2014 11:50 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize"],"ID":"178513"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Very intense body high.

Which I assume is a trait of an outdoor/greenhouse grow which, in my experience, means less THC content and thus why it was a mid-shelf choice at my local dispensary.\n\nThis marijuana had little to no real unique taste and left my mouth ash dry after the first hit but following my exhale I could already feel more sunk into my bed but lighter in my head (lol unintentional rhyme).  I couldn't even finish a bowl out of my medium sized pipe!  I'd get half way through it and just get so relaxed and feel good I'd either just absent mindedly neglect it or want to save it for later!  But this is definitely a med to smoke at night after you have completed whatever it is you planned on doing today, haha, like work or errands!  It has heavy couch locking traits/heavy body high of a potent indica.  And very good for back pain as I work in the restaurant industry and have occasional lower back pain from standing for long periods and lifting heavy trays (as well as working out, but that's just natural soreness), God's Gift definitely worked much better than my usual Aleve and it helped stimulate my appetite as I have had serious stomach issues after getting off heroin and losing 40 pounds in 2 months...

Been an avid bud toker for 8 years now, have tried plenty of strains since then and this one definitely leaves a mark. If you're lucky enough to get some of same buds as me you can expect some definite kick in your hit. This is easily one of the more potent of buds I've smoked. Is it the greatest strain I've ever smoked? Definitely not, but It's name and potency definitely leave a mark. It gives you some pretty epic dry eyes and I added \"Loss of Memory\" to the effects list because it does give you a major dose of that. Don't know why that isn't an pre-added effect I definitely feel certain strains effect that more than others, Oh well. The taste is not the greatest either but it's not the worst. It's all preference! I think the potency of this particular strain easily makes up for it! So yeah, definitely would recommend this strain if you're considering it or saw it at your local dispensary and get it before it's gone! Hope this helps!

Here is mine..  Firstly, every harvest is going to be different.  A 'brand' can have a huge variety of effects.  Depending on the grower and his skill and techniques.   Those obvious details aside. After trying BD for a third time I finally found some that had all the classic BD qualities.\n\nThe aroma was a cross of a blue berry with just a slightly stronger skunk hiding in there.  The flowers I had sported a nice trim and averaged about the size of a dime in circumference and about 1 to 2 inches in length.  There was a little bag wear so the pistils (hairs) were slightly damaged but still present with a red/orange coloring.   There was still a substantial amount of trichomes visible and after a rough grinding I still captured very fine trichome residue.  So fine, in fact, that all of it produced would have been lost.  Grind a ounce and you get a lot still yet.  Once ground much of the skunky aroma had left, leaving a grassy, berry scent.   This bag was cured well and I would wager was cultivated in doors.  Smoking was typical to nearly all flowers.  Onset is usually rapid starting in the head.  Though a little spacey it never left me zoned out. (at least in the amount I prefer)   I found it to be relaxing and makes a nice day time smoke.  It holds to its sativa parent and stimulates the mind with little sedation.  In fact, I found it to be very stimulating.   Keeps me alert and focused late at night. Over all, this bag lived up to its name.  If all BD was created equal it would own a permanent slot in my on hand collection.  \nI can give this batch 4 stars and sleep soundly with that decision.

Taste is decent, spicy with a hint of cocoa. What does it for me is not the flavour, but the high. Which isn't as intense as heavy hitters such as, Jean Guy or 3P.

Gives you enough energy to motivate and help you through your day with a smile. The boost felt off this particular sativa is motivating and happy  without that speedy sensation. You won't get the urge to climb mount Washington or run a marathon, as aforementioned it will help with daily tasks.\n\nFrom a herb smoker, I love this strain for daytime use. Whether vaped or rolled, the inhales and exhales are smooth, almost non existent in certain batches. Growing has some influence on smoothness, regardless of the methods, it remains one of the smoothest strains I've tried. \n\nThose who suffer adverse affects from certain sativas (mind racing, paranoia, edgy, etc...), but still enjoy the boost you can't get from an indica (sense star exception), May want to try this strain.

By S and I we're talking about cannabinoid proportions, not necessarily genetics.

The great Indicas, like this one, step up with a more focused mental light. No anxious \"up\", no brick-head, but an honest emotional relax, that wears off into a thoughtful calm.  \n\nMany hybrids  juggle a Sativa head with enough Indica body effect to relieve pain without too much stupor. Some are great compromises. With a good Indica, the Sativa side isn't even necessary.

When I first smoked this strain I was originally disappointed but it was still better than anything local I could buy. I have done more research and realized I prefer a strain with more Indica like Northern Light. Based on my personal preferences smoking this over the last few months has given me an appreciation for hybrids like this, and I will try out a similar strain in the very near future. I probably will not however, go out and seek out the El Nino seeds again, as there seem to be better hybrids to choose from since this came out a long time ago.

The high is not kush-smooth, it's a bit jittery in the brain like a Sativa should be, which is what i need to work creatively, and  why I'm on this site now, it's motivating.  The body effects of theKush's Indica are intact as well.  \n\nAha! I did some research just now. It's actually got Power Plant as well as something called Lavender.  I can now say the sativa is part is definitely feeling like PP, yes indeed. \n\nTaste really is cotton candy, which really isn't too bad compared to some other flavors that can overwhelm (Champagne and Sour Diesel come to mind). \n\nThis one (surprising for me) goes to the top 10 in my current favorites, I'll just call it Cotton Candy however,  it doesn't have enough Kush characteristics to be called  kush, and one site claims it is only PP and Lavender, no Kush at all in its heritage.","strain":"cotton-candy-kush","user":"flyboy","stars":"3.5","date":"7/25/2014 12:59 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Euphoric","Focused","Happy","Relaxed","Tingly","Uplifted","Dizzy"],"ID":"183024"},{"_type":"dict","content":"great taste and very sticky! it is a good strain for uplifting but it doesn't rush you or makes you tingle like Candy Jack strain although its pretty good!\n\ndue to stickiness it burns slower that another strain and it makes you feel  high but energetic!\n\n8.7/10!","strain":"super-sour-diesel","user":"Daniello","stars":"3.5","date":"7/25/2014 1:26 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Uplifted","Skunk","Pungent"],"ID":"183025"},{"_type":"dict","content":"pineapple express at nw alchemy is the bomb, perfect fruity sativa hybrid","strain":"pineapple-express","user":"jediconcentrates","stars":"5","date":"7/25/2014 1:31 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Focused","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Uplifted","Sweet","Tropical","Pineapple"],"ID":"183026"},{"_type":"dict","content":"love the fire alien og, northwest alchemy has the most potent terpy flower for good deals all day, great for pain or insomnia, will knock you out","strain":"fire-og","user":"jediconcentrates","stars":"5","date":"7/25/2014 1:34 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Focused","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Earthy","Pungent","Skunk","Chemical","Ammonia","Diesel","Spicy/Herbal"],"ID":"183027"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Alien Chem OG\n7/24/14\nShark Bait\nNice medium body buzz ","strain":"alien-og","user":"HeyWine","stars":"4","date":"7/25/2014 3:07 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Tingly"],"ID":"183028"},{"_type":"dict","content":"very uplifiting good weed","strain":"purple-diesel","user":"Ayoosammmy","stars":"5","date":"7/25/2014 3:32 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"183029"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"gods-gift","user":"JoeyBah","stars":"4","date":"7/24/2014 6:51 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Talkative","Uplifted","Anxious","Euphoric","Happy"],"ID":"183051"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"king-louis","user":"parisime4","stars":"5","date":"7/24/2014 8:02 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Sleepy","Creative","Happy"],"ID":"183052"},{"_type":"dict","content":"this is the best medicine for pain","strain":"raspberry-kush","user":"Flores13","stars":"0","date":"7/24/2014 5:33 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"183050"},{"_type":"dict","content":"One of my most favorite strains!

Second wave hits after about 5 min. Total brain eraser. Overall effect is highly cerebral and euphoric. Can cause a false couch-lock effect as you will disconnect from reality and daydream without even realising it. Very manageable if you want to keep moving, just don't do anything that requires coherent thought or focused concentration. Very creative if you don't let it distract you. High lasts solid for 2-3hrs in the head then mellows to a warm body buzz. High consumption has drastically magnified effects as far as destroying competent motor functions.

It's a confusing thing that I don't want to get too much into that tends to affect teens. It causes shit tons of symptoms, but the ones important to this are nausea, vomiting, headaches, migraines, and general pain concentrated in my legs. It got so bad that I wasn't able to walk for a year and a half. \nI always thought that marijuana might be an effective treatment for my POTS, though I didn't know what it was at the time I didn't get diagnosed until I was 16, and my depression, but lived in rural Missouri so my chances were slim of getting it there. I knew one person who had access, but I was too scared to ask her because it was so taboo there. A friend of mine who now smokes there tells me that it runs about $50 a gram, so I'm kinda glad I didn't pick up smoking there. \nI moved to the Chicago suburbs, probably the worst place in American, a few years later. Weed was accessible there, but was still pretty taboo. I went to the mayo clinic for my disorder a few months after I moved there and attended a rehab program that taught me to walk again. They also told me that, for my health, I should avoid marijuana and other drugs. I spent two horrible  years in Chicago where I was bullied, mostly when I couldn't walk because I couldn't walk, and then ignored by every person I came across. \nMy dad got a job out in Colorado eventually. He was going to move there by himself and my mom brother and I were gonna stay in chiraq until our house sold. I convinced him to let me move out with him and I ended up moving to Denver. \nI, because I lived in Denver, discovered weed and how great it was. My dad caught me one day and the combination of his Jewish guilt, my Missouri anti weed guilt, and my ignorance of the plant made me doubt that smoking was a good thing to do and that I was addicted and all that stuff. I went on a tolerance break, which made me discover I wasn't as addicted as I thought, and I started researching the science behind marijuana and completely changed my mind. It helps a majority of my problems, all that I listed out in particular. \nAnyways, enough background, sorry if it was too much, here's what I have to say about this strain:\nMy POTS has been acting up as of late. It's basically been in remission for that past 8 months or so, but it decided to randomly unleash itself a few days ago. It's made walking hard and I haven't been eating due to nausea. I'd been smoking this strain, silver pearl, which was nice but didn't help any of my medical problems. I picked up an 1/8th of this today. I smoked a bowl and my nausea vanished. The pain in my legs subsided significantly, and the pain in my back and arms, the pain had spread from just my legs to include those that morning, was abolished. It's a good strain that'd is recommend to any recreational or medical user. It had a pleasant high too. I've taken the hardest of hard medicines for all my symptoms, but nothing helps even half as much as a good indica, or any kind of weed really. Thank god for marijuana and let's hope for a speedy legalization.

It goes down real smooth as long as you don't take a strong hit. When you do take a strong hit it feels like your stomach is going to come out through your mouth. At first I thought it was because we smoked a huge blunt the first time we'd ever had JF but now I know it's not that. Jack Frost is really potent and can get you pretty far gone in a few hits. But after that few hits is when everything changed my life. I started feeling really trippy. Everything freaked me out. Walking was a fucking process. It felt like everything was shifting around me. It also turns off the stop-eating-you're-full switch. Every time I smoke this weed I eat until I feel like my stomach is going to burst and that trips me out more. I have to focus on TV to keep myself from freaking out. Overall I gave Jack Frost here a high rating because my girlfriend doesn't really trip out like me but she does trip a lot with this strain so it's probably laced. I'm sure that if it wasn't laced Jack Frost would be a favorite. Don't let my review keep you from trying it just make sure it's not laced otherwise your life will be miserable while you smoke, after you smoke, and when you wake up the next morning.","strain":"jack-frost","user":"somniumtextrix","stars":"4","date":"7/27/2014 4:48 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Paranoid","Anxious","Hungry","Euphoric","Giggly"],"ID":"185166"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Picked up an 1/8 and it was the best stuff I picked up that day.

I have been reviewing strains on Leafly for nearly a year now, and have tried oodles from dispensaries in the Seattle area. None have stuck out in my memory so well as Schrom.\n\nI first tried this strain 1-2 months ago, and got the batch from Have a Heart Cafe by way of Kevin's Gardens. I came in looking for a sativa and the smell of Schrom took my heart right away. It's piney aroma is peppered with a touch of lemon-lime; it smells like a delicious all natural soda. The taste is even better. This is, without a doubt, the most delicious strain I've ever tasted.\n\nThe effects leave nothing to be desired. This strain can really do all the description says; it's as if it acclimates to your needs and desires. If used early in the day, it provides a calm high (body and mind) that doesn't disrupt clarity, but instead amplifies creativity and motivation. If used in the evening, it adjusts to your pace, slowing down for relaxation that eventually gives way to dreamy slumbers.\n\nWith Romulan as a parent, it adequately provides pain relief, soothing muscles and calming nerves, without being overburdened with the heavy indica tendency to promote constant drowsiness. \n\nIf you can find Schrom in your area, do yourself a favorite and TRY IT RIGHT NOW.","strain":"schrom","user":"piccadilley","stars":"5","date":"7/28/2014 8:47 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Happy","Relaxed","Lime","Lemon","Pine"],"ID":"185289"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"lemon-skunk","user":"jasminemarie","stars":"4","date":"7/27/2014 4:28 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Energetic","Happy","Relaxed","Talkative"],"ID":"185290"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Fantastic,  powerfull high ","strain":"death-star","user":"LOTT130","stars":"5","date":"7/27/2014 5:27 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Focused","Hungry","Talkative","Earthy"],"ID":"185291"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Very strong head high.

It races straight to your head and gives you a very heady Sativa high that is followed by a burst of energy.

Honestly if you got your hands on this back in the day your were a boss. Great hard to explain strain, it has an exceptional scent that just reeks and makes you want to get a nug and hold it under your nose all day. Very pungent musky herbal skunky piney and spicy earthy undertones perhaps a slight scent of lime when smelled closely not as prominent as the other scents likes pine, could be do to different growing environments.

I found that it made me less socially anxious, was energizing (sativa-dominant), and combines the analgesic effect THC has on my nerve pain (L4-L5 nerve compression) with the anti-inflammatory quality of CBD - it's working for my heel issue too (plantar fasciitis).  it's a kind of 'Goldilocks' strain: energizing, anti-anxiety, analgesic.  full disclosure: I'm a lightweight, so a bong hit's worth in my magic flight (about 10 vapes) gave me a light THC buzz, reminiscent of what I got after smoking a joint in the early 1970's.  if you're used to consuming 1/2 g. of flower at a session, you probably won't get a THC buzz.  I'll need to do further 'research', but, having tried other high CBD strains and not finding them very effective for my issues, as well as taking CBD and CBD/THC caps, which only worked sometimes - esp. the hybrid caps in tandem with Ibuprofen, I think this may be the best of all for someone who has 'hybrid' (nerve + inflammation) pain.

I doubt iMedz still has this on their menu at the time of this submission (8.5.2014)\n\nI was lucky enough to find this in concentrate form, and I've also had the flower before. The effects and aromas are comparably identical. I sometimes refer to this as the \"lead-band\", because I had the feeling of immense weight on my head. Time after time, it's as if my neck cannot support the weight of my head, and I often slouch. Up to and after the peak, the same effects persists, but by this point I am slackjawed, almost-drooling, and eye lids turn to lead. There is no other strain of cannabis I've tried that delivers this level of debilitation, over and over, and leads me to think it's rather difficult to build a tolerance to this. But, then again, I tend to prefer sativas, and only keep 1 or 2 indicas around at a given time for the purpose of putting me to sleep.\n\nI took off half a star because, as this is a review on the concentrate, it had moisture and turned into a sappy, sugary, opaque goop. I even asked the budtender if this shatter would auto-budder or get soft over time, and he retorted \"Hell Naw!\" I should've took that response for an omen, because those were my exact words when I first discovered it buddered! I vaguely remember the looks of the budtender, but I won't put him on blast. This was acquired from iMedz San Jose by the extractor alias 'Nuthin but Nectar'. It was untested. I usually don't get untested meds, but this Herojuana suits its purpose perfectly for those insomnia nights. Even if it's potentially tane-soup, it's still a pleasure to smoke, yes I confess. The taste is unforgettable, will stick to your palate for a good hour, and stink up the room whether it's concentrate or flower. Every time I vaporize it, I smell a hint of something different.\n\nGreat strain. Highly recommended for its aforementioned purposes. But would I get it from that dispensary and extract artist again untested?

The bag appeal is amazing with dark greyish green flowers, sticky to the touch and covered in trichomes.  Even the large fan leave's 6 inch steams where covered with trichs.  It does not have an over-the-top smell and taste like the Cannatonic does or I would have given it 5 stars.  The taste is very earthy with a hint of diesel which is strange because the Cannatonic is so so sweet.  The effect is immediate and long lasting.  You can truly feel the CBD mixed with the THC - they did a great job crossing these strains.  If you took equal parts NYC Diesel flower and Cannatonic flower and ground them together your high would be the best of both worlds - exactly the effect of the Dieseltonic.  Great pain relief with happy energy and vitality.  It will put you on the couch if you let it or can be used as an all day smoke.

A couple drawbacks however, after the initial high (2 hours) this strain induces grogginess, good for medical uses I'm sure, but I don't really enjoy taking naps at 3 in the afternoon. Another drawback is the munchies. These are no ordinary munchies, you will eat and eat until your stomach hurts.

I don't mind the kind of paranoia that makes you think someone is outside, but the kind that makes you think you're going to die sucks. Could be because I started out watching Castaway, which was way to anxiety provoking. Ended up switching to music instead. Even then, some of the music was freaking me out. Like one song sounded like a helicopter and that was making me freak. These are things I shouldn't be freaking out about. The paranoia lasted for about an hour. Then, I passed out for about two hours. Woke up at 3am and had no idea I'd even fallen asleep. I felt well rested.","strain":"mango-kush","user":"shortfiction","stars":"2.5","date":"8/13/2014 5:23 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Sleepy","Talkative","Dizzy","Paranoid","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"193802"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Awesome head high.

The taste is a bit pine like but enjoyable. A bit harsh but that's due to extreme trichomes that are growing all over this dense bud.  Highly recommend, Gabber.","strain":"86bd0fb6-46d7-43b3-b332-b10d72261a4c","user":"gabbergabe","stars":"5","date":"8/14/2014 10:53 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Relaxed","Happy","Pine","Mint"],"ID":"195436"},{"_type":"dict","content":"One of my new favorite strains... can't wait for this to be regularly available somewhere.

However, I believe that to be attributed to a number of different variables.\n\nUnfortunately, the quality of the bud I received fell below expectation, even in spite of the understanding that it was sun-grown. It was not dense. It was leafy, fluffy, soft, and perhaps not cured very well, because it didn't appear to be dried to completion. Too often would it fail the \"stem test\", as I call it. The stem material wouldn't always \"snap\", as I would expect from well-dried bud.  Additionally, I found the herb rather difficult to separate from the stem. This, I believe, allowed for some unwanted stem material to get mixed in with my ground-up herb. This would seem to explain the unpredictable death-hits I would get, of which there were many. They very first time I hit it, I choked out. But regardless of those unpredictable stem-burning hits, it seemed overall a harsher toke. On occasion, it would be more friendly, but for the most part, ripping a Jay would be a bit of a chore. This is partially why I switched to vaping it.\n\nAnd what do ya know? It's 4:20 right now!\n\nAnyway, now for the effect. With some exception, I found this particular stuff's effect to be different than what I'd hoped for. Maybe if I had been working with a higher grade that was cured to perfection, I would have had a much better experience. There were only a few times in which I would smoke a Jay, or hit a freshly-packed vape, and recieve great feelings of content, and well-being. My awareness would seem to extend into my environment. At times, it would feel like I was in absolute harmony with my environment, and I'd feel as though I was experiencing myself from an expanded, more harmonious and connected perspective. This is the best thing I can say about my experience with this strain, but it was uncommon. The most common experience I had wasn't nearly as pleasurable.\n\nOf course, it would melt one's stress and anxiety upon inhaling, but the main effect, I found to be much less enjoyable than that of other Sativas. I would describe it as a pressure in one's head. A strong pressure, a heavy stoned feeling, and little else. In this case, I would describe it as a \"heady\" stone, but not very \"cerebral\". When I say cerebral, I essentially mean psychoactive.  It was only really cerebral those few awesome times when it would surprise me. This heady pressure, and heavy stoned feeling would last for what seemed like FOREVER. Now, I'm sure that a long-lasting effect would be favorable to most smokers, but not for me, and not with the stuff I had. The thing is, most Sativas and hybrid strains I've tried have a pleasurable \"gradient\", as I like to describe it. This gradient often makes for a favorable progression of effects. Not only do you get to experience a variety of changing effects, but these changes help you to not feel so \"stuck in time.\" Unfortunately, this strain did not have that variation. At least, not the bud I had. It was a relentlessly static, and enduring effect. Forget nighttime smoking with this stuff. It just lasted so damn long, and the taper was just the same effect on a painfully-slow decline. At times, especially when trying to sleep, I really felt suspended in time, and that really sucks.\n\nSomeone described this strain as the \"espresso\" of weed, and with that, I would absolutely agree. It's a very strong head stone, but not one that I, personally, enjoyed.","strain":"durban-poison","user":"FromElsewhere","stars":"1.5","date":"8/16/2014 10:12 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Hungry","Happy","Relaxed","Dizzy","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth","Headache","Earthy","Pine","Woody","Tea","Coffee"],"ID":"196423"},{"_type":"dict","content":"A very nice and functional high is always achieved with Sour Diesel","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"ItzSupperTime22","stars":"5","date":"8/17/2014 12:30 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth","Euphoric","Relaxed","Uplifted","Tingly","Focused"],"ID":"196424"},{"_type":"dict","content":"As advertised by others.

If you are lucky enough to get some superbly grown AK-47 it will be some of the best stuff you ever enjoyed.  Buuuut many people confuse its cerebral effects with a lower THC content.  That is not the case.  Most out there should be between 16-18%.  This stuff is so social and motivating that after you go through your first O, your friends will want to know how you just finished ALL your spring cleaning, summer cleaning and fall cleaning in one afternoon.   \n\nI will say this guy will get you out of the house and help you to socialize.  In fact you may never shut up unless you get super staloned.  Then goodnight.  But if you are prone to be negatively affected by things that can mentally stimulate your brain, and you have bi polar disorder or severe anxiety l, you might want to stay away.  But everyone is different.  Hope this helps!","strain":"ak-47","user":"CalyxPithman","stars":"5","date":"8/16/2014 1:40 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Dry Mouth","Energetic","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Talkative","Sleepy","Euphoric","Relaxed","Aroused","Creative","Dry Eyes","Paranoid","Uplifted"],"ID":"196588"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"og-kush","user":"ashtreez420","stars":"5","date":"8/16/2014 3:11 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Happy","Relaxed","Uplifted","Euphoric"],"ID":"196589"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Trainwreck is unreal.

I was researching ways to heal my gastrointestinal inflammation and bleeding, which contributes to most of my other problems (allergies, hormonal imbalance, fatigue, exercise intolerance, etc) and decided to give cannabis a try. \n\nI did some other strains before trying a high CBD, low THC strain. I didn't really enjoy the spaciness most highs impart; I'm one of those people that really likes my brain being as active and engaged and coherent as possible, so other strains just bored me. I really need my short term memory intact, too; that drives me crazy.\n\nSo I got a strain of Harlequin that's 15% CBD to 7% THC. Three hits gets me high, so I take two in the morning and two at night and I can function normally.\n\nI AM NOT EXAGGERATING WHEN I SAY HARLEQUIN HAS TURNED MY LIFE AROUND. Before, I would eat a very restricted diet (restricted form of paleo) to avoid all my food allergies, eat all organic, eat as much raw food as possible, etc. Even doing all this, and taking probiotics and enzymes, was not enough to really help my digestive tract much. I would feel considerably better than when I didn't do those things, but I'd still low on energy, and I still had exercise intolerance, and so on.\n\nMy first week on Harlequin I decided to test if cannabis was as effective as I'd heard on some medical forums. Ulcerative colitis patients were saying it stopped their bleeding entirely, and I found that hard to believe but I figured they had no reason to lie, and most of these people sounded like they had worse GI problems than I did too. So the first day, I ate a bunch of things I usually can't eat at all. I waited for the stuffy nose, the feeling of being hit by a truck, the need to nap... nothing ever came. My stomach never got upset. I thought surely I'd feel it the next morning -- I will always, always wake up with a stuffy nose and sore all over if I eat so much as extra sugar -- but nope. I woke up feeling better than ever. \n\nFor a FULL WEEK I just ate complete junk AND I FEEL BETTER THAN I EVER HAVE IN MY LIFE. \n\n- No more gastrintestinal bleeding. No more related pain, either.\n\n- My dietary histamine intolerance is gone completely. This is good news for my love of tea.\n\n- Normally my skin would be pallid and oily, and my face would be puffy, and I'd be breaking out. My skin looks vibrant.\n\n- My normally messed up circadian rhythms are correcting themselves: after years of sleeping 12 to 16 hours from sheer fatigue, if I go to bed at 3AM I actually have trouble sleeping past 9AM, but I feel rested and alert! I've only been on the Harlequin a short while but my sleep schedule has been creeping back to something \"normal:\" I'm going to gradually sleep earlier and waking up earlier. I'm curious to see if this will turn into an 11AM to 6AM sort of thing, which would be nice.\n\n- I had almost ZERO PMS symptoms, though mine were never very bad. Considerably less bleeding, too, and I usually have a day of heavy bleeding.\n\n- My exercise intolerance is gone! Before, my low blood pressure meant my heart had to shoot up to 220+ bpm just to get oxygen to my cells if I did any sort of cardio. It was never enough, either, so I could faint. And I always felt TERRIBLE afterwards: no sort of endorphin rush whatsoever, I just needed to nap. I went to the gym again after doing Harlequin and exercise is MUCH EASIER: my heart rate never went over 175 and I had no problem running. I wasn't tired, or in any danger of fainting, and the best part is when I was done, I FELT GREAT THE REST OF THE DAY. I've actually found myself getting the urge to go exercise, even on days that I've already exercised, when I never get that urge at all normally.\n\nI CANNOT BELIEVE JUST DOING CANNABIS DROPPED MY HEART RATE 50BPM INTO NORMAL PEOPLE TERRITORY WHEN MONTHS OF STUBBORN DETERMINATION TRYING TO WORK OUT DIDN'T DROP IT EVEN 1BPM. I sound like an informercial but I cannot get over this.\n\n- Similarly, I do not want to nap or feel like I'm going to pass out if I'm in 85F+ weather anymore. I just feel fine! So it's having a positive effect on my low blood pressure.\n\n- Libido seems to be incrementally increasing with use. I think this is a function of my hormones balancing, probably not a direct effect of a compound in Harlequin.\n\nHarlequin appears to be doing a lot of wonderful things to my hormones, whether directly or because my stomach isn't complicating matters I don't know. But I don't care. I will probably do Harlequin for the rest of my life, unless I find something similar.\n\nI doubt most people will have results as dramatic as mine, particularly if they haven't had a slew of difficult-to-target health problems, but maaaaan. If you have any of the issues I've described, I urge you to get some. I wish I had this decades ago.","strain":"harlequin","user":"nattiecakes","stars":"5","date":"8/17/2014 7:49 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Relaxed","Energetic","Happy"],"ID":"196760"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"dutch-treat","user":"Kelbot","stars":"4","date":"8/17/2014 8:03 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Hungry","Relaxed","Creative"],"ID":"196761"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Mixed with OG Kush not great I didn't feel a thing ","strain":"ak-47","user":"hemped","stars":"2","date":"8/17/2014 10:15 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Dry Mouth","Dry Eyes"],"ID":"196762"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Even though I really enjoyed this strain, experiencing some of the side effects really made me not want more.

The third one, of which I bought one gram for vaping, was this strain, Flo.\n\nThat's all we tried while in Colorado and it was perfect for easing into these new, pure strains of marijuana.\n\nThe experience was clear and focused. Very little did quite a bit to us, although we are probably at this point, utter newbies. The taste is great, and actually something I started looking forward to.

Definitely gave a stunted and somewhat couch-locked feeling but still good for relaxing and watching a movie. \n\nUsing a vaporizer this strain had a pronounced but not overwhelming citrus-like bitterness that reminded me of a lime. The high also differed in that it provided a much more gradual and full body high that lasted much longer.

Some minor pine smells left. This will hit you, be ready for a 4 (out of ten) if one person (for three people, this will get you all a good buzz, so the super sticky sample I received is starting to pay off, and early too).\n\n390 – Choke hazard, even for experienced folks. Be ready for a 6 if alone, probably a 3 or 4 if three people (this is mellow, but wants to pull you away from what you're doing and think about dwarfs and physics problems like what the 4th dimension would look like). There is also pain relief, but the major action seems to be cerebral.\n\n400 – This is very thick. Be ready for a solid 7 if alone, probably a 4 or 5 if three people (this is now hitting like a wet blanket – it just wants to put you to sleep, go find a nice comfortable place, because you are going to have some awesome dreams).\n\n410 – This is starting to change in consistency; less mass, but still hits you hard. Now you're just high. A single user needs to stop at this point. Three people would probably be well toasted.\n\n420 – Hitting again after a four-hour break. Took care of some things in the house, let the displacement wear off (about an hour), went to the gym, and then returned home and now medicating for pain (everywhere, but most especially in shoulders, neck, lower back, and legs). After half a bag, both the pain itself and the concern for the pain are fading. Lungs and throat are very sensitive after 2 hours of intense cardio (85%+ heart rate), but the vapor is not harsh if sipped instead of gulped. Also drinking water and coffee. Finished bag, \n\n433 – Where you find out if you paid too much. The vapor is now nearly invisible, but is still smooth (no “burnt popcorn” that some people complain about). Even someone with large lungs can pull a full drag and not worry about coughing (which is a blessing and curse – this will sneak up on you). Not the same power as when fresh, but still delivering.\n\n433 x2 – A little more harsh on the tongue, but still able to pull full lungs. There is a bit left in this, but it's probably getting thin by now.\n\n433 x3 – Tried to run another bag, got nothing but air; when dumping the tumbler the weed that was formerly sticking to itself (and anything else) fell into the trash like dry coffee grounds, almost powder is basically all that's left over.\n\nOverall I'm impressed with this strain and recommend those looking for pain relief and the ability to put yourself to sleep (or enjoy it gradually, as shown above) give it a try.","strain":"dream-queen","user":"2dogsfull","stars":"4","date":"8/19/2014 3:36 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Energetic","Focused","Relaxed","Sleepy","Uplifted","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"197103"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"granddaddy-purple","user":"russ311","stars":"3.5","date":"8/19/2014 2:03 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy","Relaxed","Dry Mouth","Dry Eyes"],"ID":"197130"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"mango-kush","user":"yodahitsbong420","stars":"4","date":"8/19/2014 3:40 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Focused","Talkative","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"197131"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Very potent high, one of my personal favorites so far, this strain takes little too give a good stone, first time smokers are not suggested too use this strain.

This is a great alternative to the pharmacutical drug addiction I can tell ya that for sure. problem they say we have with them a medication that helps there symptoms and they don't get addicted to except maybe some form of medical addition I have never experienced any adverse effects after taking my medication each day never happened when I got up the next day either. It's a great way to relieve the same problems you take a lot of different kinds of pills you currently take can be replaced by this and no one has to smoke it there is pretty any way you canhink of and use it safely. there are medical marijuana restraunts that put cannabis in the food and you eat it that's great! if ya use good herb I like the taste of good herb the only problem is that eating it doesn't ever seem to work for me. :(( So I live in a Vaporor world or a bong hit :(( oh well vaporizing you get the taste of the medication in each dose you take only negative is that is uses more medication. If you can afford the expense of the extra medication then this is the way to go. It also seems to relieve symptoms a little bit different when smoke vs vaporizing but it still relieves the symptoms very well. The one thing I haven't nailed down yet with this medication is the taste. Every time I use the medication I find additional information I never saw the time before, So tracking log entries. I make one pretty much everytime I use my medication.

It relaxed my body but opened my mind. I was more spatially aware and better able to make associations between things than I am sober. I felt spiritual and philosophical. But also giggly and stupid. I often found myself laughing hard over nothing...so I had a really good time. I felt euphoric, but not horny like I've felt with other strains that have caused euphoria. I experienced no muscle twitches, and no bad trips. I did have tactile hallucinations--pine needles and leaves I unexpectedly contacted felt like fire. Additionally, tactile sensations traveled throughout my body--touching something with a fingertip allowed me to feel what i'd touched other places as well. I also felt associations between senses (not to be confused with hallucinations across multiple sensory planes). Feeling certain things made me think of certain colour patterns, but not hallucinate them per se. I experienced munchies pretty quickly and and I had very mild cotton mouth (it was enough to notice, but not to bother me). I sometimes lost my train of thought when speaking, and was sometimes unable to recover an out-loud thought after noticing my own grammatical errors, but I never felt anxious or frustrated with my deficits and I felt I was able to maintain conversation adequately. I felt relaxed, but didn't feel sleepy until I was tucked in for the night. I liked this strain especially because I didn't at all feel anxious as I sometimes do when I trip a little.

It's the archetypal weed you think about when you think about all the portrayals of marijuana in film, television, and song. Dank as hell. Small to medium-sized nuggets of hazy green, with blue-grey undertones, give off a smell so powerful you can sniff it in the air from half a block away. Seriously...good luck trying to hide this stuff from your friends or family. I put my stash in a vacuum-locked container, placed in an airtight ziploc bag, placed inside another ziploc bag, placed in a brown paper bag, in a carboard box in the bottom of a stuffed closet. Those precautions weren't enough to contain the smell. Fortunately, it's a wonderful smell, with hints of earth and pine, sage and lemongrass. All base notes, no top notes.\n\nThere's some debate as to the genetics of OG Kush, and no two experts can agree on the proportions of sativa and indica in its heritage. From what I can tell of the high, it's almost an even split, with slightly more indica-driven effects (at least as I experience them). A few tokes will put you into a slow, dreamlike haze. You'll feel fuzzy around the edges. You might get intensely horny, as I did. On the comedown, you'll still have most of your senses and your faculties about you, and you can make good use of the creative energy for writing, music, art, or any other endeavors. A lot of this high takes place in your head, with mild to moderate body effects and a decent, but not overwhelming sense of couch lock. Like I said, it seems a 50/50 split between sativa-like and indica-like effects. Maybe 40/60.\n\nI recommend this strain, without reservation or hyperbole, as one of the best around.","strain":"og-kush","user":"jmalibu","stars":"5","date":"8/24/2014 6:47 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Creative","Relaxed","Dry Eyes","Headache","Happy","Sleepy","Uplifted"],"ID":"199970"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"purple-urkle","user":"clevelandkush","stars":"4","date":"8/24/2014 6:54 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Energetic","Euphoric","Happy","Talkative","Uplifted"],"ID":"199971"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This was my first time trying this strain and I was amazed at how good it was.

Very impressed with this strain and would recommend to anyone who is stressed.","strain":"ak-47","user":"snowboarderxyz","stars":"4","date":"8/26/2014 1:42 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"201421"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Top shelf Medical Marijuana Strains available such as:\n- Girl Scout Cookies\n- Blueberry Yum Yum\n- Sour Diesel\n- Purple Kush\n- Mango Kush\n- Green Crack\n- Ballsack\n- Grand Daddy Purple\n- Sour OG Kush\n- Afghan KUSH\n- AK47 x Skunk\n- Grapefruit O.G.\n- The Blue Dreamer\n- All-Star\n- Chemdawg-4\n- Outdoor Jack Herrer\n- Purple Lavendar\n- Bubba kush\n- Master kush\n- Ultra kush\n- White widow\n- Northern Lights\n- white widow\n- Sensi Star x ak-47\n- Northern Lights\n- Lemon drop\n- OG kush\n- Purple-urkle\n\nFor inquiries:\ncontact via text at this number (567) 297-7569\nReach us at mariogarcia063@gmail.com or skype at mario.garcia7252 for discreet delivery to get high ASAP.","strain":"kosher-kush","user":"mario.garcia","stars":"0.5","date":"8/26/2014 1:43 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize"],"ID":"201422"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Top shelf Medical Marijuana Strains available such as:\n- Girl Scout Cookies\n- Blueberry Yum Yum\n- Sour Diesel\n- Purple Kush\n- Mango Kush\n- Green Crack\n- Ballsack\n- Grand Daddy Purple\n- Sour OG Kush\n- Afghan KUSH\n- AK47 x Skunk\n- Grapefruit O.G.\n- The Blue Dreamer\n- All-Star\n- Chemdawg-4\n- Outdoor Jack Herrer\n- Purple Lavendar\n- Bubba kush\n- Master kush\n- Ultra kush\n- White widow\n- Northern Lights\n- white widow\n- Sensi Star x ak-47\n- Northern Lights\n- Lemon drop\n- OG kush\n- Purple-urkle\n\nFor inquiries:\ncontact via text at this number (567) 297-7569\nReach us at mariogarcia063@gmail.com or skype at mario.garcia7252 for discreet delivery to get high ASAP.","strain":"afghan-kush","user":"mario.garcia","stars":"0.5","date":"8/26/2014 1:49 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize"],"ID":"201423"},{"_type":"dict","content":"this is one of my favorite strains yet! it makes me feel giggly, talkative, eases my stress, and helps the pain subside. doesn't make you cough, and definitely gives me indica and stativa effects.

I am a fairly heavy smoker with a VERY high tolerance unfortunately. To give this strain credit, I felt effects after vaping a couple bowls, so the potency is decent- again about average. After about 4-6 small bowls,  I was relaxed but not tired and although I didn't have a ton of energy, I did have enough to get a few things done before bed. It neither helped me sleep nor kept me up. It really was just mellow. It decreased anxiety and made me feel relaxed but didn't feel the boost in mood that I do with some strains. The effect was a true balance of a cerebral high with body effects. Physically, I did feel a bit stimulated but like the rest of the effects, it almost felt a bit muted, maybe if I would have smoked more, this would have been stronger. This strain doesn't meet my needs, because I need my medication to give me definitive effects- whether it's energy and focus from a sativa or pain relief and sedation from an indica. I may just need to stick with true indicas and sativas and steer clear from hybrids. This is probably a good strain for casual smokers who are just looking for a mellow high after work.

Amnesia haze gives you a smooth smoke which after the first rotation you start to feel, in comparison to it's brother Lemon haze I would say that they are similar yet so different in other ways. With lemon haze you can expect the high to creep in after a few rotations or even after a full spliff whereas with amnesia the buzz seems to set it nearly straight away. The citrus taste is something most Haze strands seem to share but I personally would say amnesia is more enjoyable as the smooth hit you get seems to ease down your throat, rest in your lungs and give you a kick which makes smoking it all that worthwhile. The morning after is something which is not a major problem in comparison to lemon haze as the feeling of dry mouth is not so much a problem with Amnesia Haze. I would say amnesia is a more creative buzz compared to anything else and I say this only because I've just smoked a blunt and a few spliffs of it now ;). I would say the only criticism is that the buzz does not last long compared to other similar strands which can be acquired just as easy.

(GOOD THING) Overall, i was extremley impressed, and very lucky to acquire this. i did a good deed for someone, which they were physically unable to do. said person has card. asked me if i would like some dispensary released g13. i politley declined, as it was this poor old mans medicine. he had over 118gs, but it was HIS. after i told him no aout 4 times, he retreated the sample back to his drawer. aafter some time of performing the requested chore (painting the house), I left the room to make a phone call and check in with the fiance. on my walk home i noticed a severe reek of marijuana, an insane odour that seemed to be following me. as i entered my home i realized it was coming from tere...or so i thought. I went to empty my bag to retrieve my ipod, and out falls a 7.4g nug of g13, vaccum sealed in a bag, with a smiley face drawn on it that said \"My charity in exchange for yours, no returns :)\" lol! needless to say i was very impressed, and this is to date the best example out of a few ive had of G-13. excellent strain for sleep and any other desired Indica traits.

There's a very important part of picking the right medication. I like the 50/50 split when we actually really accomplished and the proof is post for other people to review to. I heard a few growers try and say they have accomplished the 50\\50 split which in theory is supoose to make a medicine that works at hight and during the day to just like the earlier days.It's a nice medication and what I tested so far has been good. I want to try the vaporizer but I would probably have to use a gram to do it and I only had 3.5 to begin with. If I had more I think this would also make a very good vaporizer medication. Vaporizers always use more medication then a bong would but with the vapor if it has a flavoring then those I usually like to use the vaporizer so I can have the taste in each hit I take :0) I haven't quite nailed the taste down yet so there will be more to come as I learn new things.","strain":"b353e3f7-6c83-4529-8150-dbc0aac6fb59","user":"jeffmc","stars":"4","date":"9/1/2014 1:10 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Happy","Relaxed","Creative","Focused","Energetic","Dry Mouth","Earthy","Cheese","Tropical","Berry","Sweet"],"ID":"203524"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blackberry-kush","user":"maddiemeow","stars":"4","date":"9/1/2014 1:57 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Hungry","Sleepy","Relaxed"],"ID":"203525"},{"_type":"dict","content":"amazing bud, soft and spongy, frosty, super euphoric with an energetic feeling and a lot of giggling","strain":"alien-og","user":"Jmouz","stars":"4","date":"9/1/2014 4:10 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Energetic","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Talkative","Tingly","Uplifted","Earthy","Pungent","Woody","Nutty","Diesel"],"ID":"203526"},{"_type":"dict","content":"classic.. always a good choice","strain":"blue-dream","user":"Bongwater25","stars":"4","date":"9/1/2014 5:01 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Relaxed","Uplifted","Blueberry","Skunk"],"ID":"203527"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Patient report:\nAverage.

I smoked a bit of this wonderful bud and in about 10-15 minutes the nausea had subsided, though not all together completely. I at least had the appetite to stomach a couple slices of toast which sealed the deal.\n\nLater on I ran into my neighbor and invited her to come over and sesh. We'd smoked together a few times, but my neighbor and I had our first real bonding experience when I brought this strain to the table. As a girl, I often feel stressed around other girls but instead I felt completely comfortable  and sociable as we talked for a couple hours and even came up with a name for my new piece of glass. Overall I would say it was an excellent choice for relieving stress, anxiety and good for socializing and creativity.

The only negative is the munchies- wow! My suggestion is to stock up on stuff prior to smoking, or have a waffle house within walking distance- you're gonna crave and crave bad!

I am not the one who developed this but I thought I would at least give the medical users some insite into it effects so people can start getting an idea if it might work for them to. When I took the medication this morning I didn't get the brief bump you always do with all medications. The one's that help with sleep that will wear off very quickly and then you become tired. This is a lot like OG Kush although it has a sweeter taste. I used my Ice Pipe this morning because I didn't want to deal with the vaporizer this early. I will use it in the Vape and give a review on that to. It has a nice smooth medication process This medication is best suited at least at this point and what I know now that it would make a great daytime medication. Since it has the berry taste it would probably be best used out of the vaporizer. More on that later. It also has what I think is also a bit of a pine taste. It is not that strong but adds a very nice sweet and earthy combination to it. As far as I can Tell now this will make a great daytime medication. I would say even with the potency of this medication Which at this point I have taken three hours ago so it lasts quite a while. It helps with Stress and Pain, as well as the nerve damage and arthritis very well for me and it still doesn't seem to make me tired. More to come as I experience more. :0) A great daytime medication. New users should watch how much they use at first till they are use to it ! It is also great for the veteran user also, This is a very nice medication. Always remember that your vaporizer usually uses more medication then a Bong but with the sweetness of this and the blend of flavors if you can afford to pay for the extra medication vaporizing takes then I think that would be the best way. You get the taste in every dose and with a bong you usually just get the taste when you first start taking it and again when you are done and blow out the smoke: More to come on this strain. Don't hesitate to buy it it is a great medication and this provides some information for people to refer to. I am not sure of the THC level but I would say it falls between 15 and 20. This a medication that is also very medication out of a bong. When I take it I get a bit of a sweet taste something like a berry and when I exale it tastes more earthy like maybe pine and it is a very smooth medication. It gives you a boost but doesn't make it feel like your hair is standing up or something like that. I just took another hit to make sure this is as accurate as I can get it right now. I would recommend this to veterans and new users as well. But Take it easy at first newbies and nothing with happen that may worry you. This is a nice smooth medication. Marajuana is a lot like a pain pill. I have taken pain pills so long that I don't get the high feeling or whatever they want to call it when I take it anymore I just feel normal as usual. Medical Marajuana has reduced the amount of pill medication in have to use considerably but with my cancer I still have to take for pain pills a day when I use to take twelve or more. I think like when I used it for my back though I could stop taking pain pills all together. Take from someone who knows that taking those pills all the time is not going to have a good effect on your body. Now I use Medical Marajuana and very little pills a lot of people I believe wouldn't need pills even if they find the right Marajuana medication for them I know it worked for me and I feel a lot better physically and mentally from using Medical Marajuana There's not all the side effects you experience with pills \"Especially with PAIN MEDICATION.\" The worse thing that can happen to you from using cannabis is if you smoke to much daytime or nighttime medication recommended \" You will just fall asleep\" for a while and wake up and feel fine Unless someone has added something to the flower to try and make it more potent like dipping it in opium. Not a good thing to use so watch out if you don't buy it from a reputable dispensery. You can use any part of this information if you wish. At least I can try and do what I can to try and help people see that the pills and other crap is junk and not a good \"Long term\" solution. I have used this twice now for medical purposes once for my back which then I could stop taking the pills all together. I have a ruptured disk. Now I use it with my cancer and it is working great for helping reduce the pills I have to take that are not good for you like \"PAIN PILLS\". The reason I am on the pain pill issue so much is when you run into chronic pain you will take this and if you don't control yourself then you will end up addicted to this crap and I can also tell you from personal experience those are withdrawal symptoms you don't want to experience. OK that's it for now folks more to come as I use a bit more of this medication and as I learn new stuff I will post it.","strain":"bc026145-6714-4fd8-a466-9b6237726c9b","user":"jeffmc","stars":"4.5","date":"8/30/2014 7:09 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Creative","Energetic","Focused","Relaxed","Happy","Uplifted","Dry Mouth","Sweet","Berry","Blueberry","Tropical","Pine","Earthy"],"ID":"203728"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Más que Amnesia podría llamarse Anestesia XD\nMe dejó muy apalancado (estaba viendo Enter the Void, buena peli para estar morado pero solo por los efectos especiales), pero lo que sí noté y mis amigos también es un hormigueo por toda la cara, especialmente en la boca, tenia la boca y parte de la cara dormidas como si me las hubieran anestesiado, esto me puso algo nervioso pero no me puse ansioso.

At first, was taken aback by how regular looking this bud was. Then, after letting it rehydrate in a humid environment, I was blown away.\nThis stuff had so many of white crystals on its surface. I was overwhelmed with a sharp citric acid smell that reminded me exactly of oranges and blue raspberry warheads, which really calls back to the point that this strain is a sativa-dominant cross between two different strains: Colorado Cup winner Blue Dream, and Orange Kush, both of which work so well in combatting stress and depression, according to Leafly.\nThis is some of the dopest dope I’ve ever seen come through here. It is definitely not your average chronic that can be found anywhere by anyone. This stuff is medicinal, and it said it right on the bag. The look of the weed correlates and is so perfectly matched on Leafly that it couldn’t be anything other than the medicinal strain that is Orange Dream. \nA little lesson on why it’s called Orange Dream and not Blue Kush: you name strains based on the male/female plants you use. Male first, then female after. Since this is true, we know that the Orange Kush plant used was the male, and Blue Dream plant was the female. This indicates that it is around 60% sativa, and 40% indica, and represents all of each’s best traits: the euphoric head high and motivation to get up and do things, and the relaxing stress reliever that an indica can provide.\nSimply one of the best strains I’ve ever come across, in nug size and potential to smoke less and get higher.\nThis is definitely not something you come across every other day, so when you see it you should pick some up.\nJ","strain":"0349fb3b-7320-4da2-b189-7baf96dc8cc1","user":"BeaverReviewer","stars":"3.5","date":"9/1/2014 8:44 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Creative","Aroused","Focused","Happy","Relaxed","Hungry","Uplifted","Dizzy","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth","Orange","Lemon","Blueberry","Strawberry","Grape","Rose","Blue Cheese","Pine","Coffee","Diesel","Sage"],"ID":"203963"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"plushberry","user":"drizzler","stars":"4","date":"9/1/2014 8:51 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed"],"ID":"203964"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"lamb-s-bread","user":"robbies","stars":"5","date":"9/1/2014 11:27 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize"],"ID":"203965"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This is nice to mellow out at the end of the day and go to sleep.","strain":"g-13","user":"vixon2","stars":"5","date":"9/2/2014 1:28 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Sleepy"],"ID":"203966"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Sweet lemony-scented tight buds of medium potency that make it feasible for daytime use.","strain":"power-kush","user":"bob.poore","stars":"3","date":"9/2/2014 2:20 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Relaxed","Hungry","Euphoric","Tingly","Uplifted","Lemon","Lime","Skunk"],"ID":"203967"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"plushberry","user":"enemylemon","stars":"4","date":"9/2/2014 2:21 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Sleepy","Uplifted","Relaxed","Happy","Tingly","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"203968"},{"_type":"dict","content":"It's perfect \uD83D\uDE0D","strain":"headband","user":"stoner1108","stars":"5","date":"9/2/2014 4:42 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"203969"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-widow","user":"azpantherguy","stars":"0.5","date":"9/2/2014 5:32 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Creative","Euphoric","Relaxed"],"ID":"203971"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Sweet and stable high.

This bud didn't exactly take the cake as far as looks go, but let me tell you one break and trichomes are very apparent. It's makes up for it in the smell and taste. First initial scent is an earthy almost slightly pumpkin and carries on into a sweet juicy berry aroma. Very smooth smoke, not harsh at all on the inhale. Great for physical pain and or depression. As soon as you take a puff, a heavy indica effect sets into your body. About 5-10 minutes afterwards a nice subtle sativa tone reveals it's presence. This is a savy hybrid fond of bringing relaxation and hunger. This is a good all day smoke, and an even better treat when the moon is in the sky. If you're looking soothe yourself from pain or discomfort this is a great strain for you. If you're fond of happy feelings from the blueberry genetics and are a fan of Indica, then you will love this strain.","strain":"blue-widow","user":"universal3xpression","stars":"4.5","date":"9/1/2014 8:40 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Relaxed","Uplifted","Hungry","Happy","Sweet","Berry","Blueberry","Pungent","Earthy"],"ID":"204266"},{"_type":"dict","content":"very strong,  relaxing, body high","strain":"white-fire-alien-og","user":"seanjb","stars":"0","date":"9/1/2014 9:01 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Sleepy"],"ID":"204267"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"jack-herer","user":"madMFmike","stars":"5","date":"9/1/2014 11:41 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Uplifted","Energetic","Focused","Pine"],"ID":"204268"},{"_type":"dict","content":"had a bowl and a half off a one hitter, GONE","strain":"death-star","user":"majicdraggin","stars":"0","date":"9/2/2014 12:05 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Giggly","Hungry","Sleepy","Tingly"],"ID":"204269"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Excellent, cerebral high without the jitters or paranoia you'd expect in a strong sativa.

I don't usually smoke hybrids so I'm not sure if the high I got was from the strain itself or if I just got a really good hybrid-high, but I felt completely relaxed and happy. My eyelids were heavy and my mouth was a little dry, I was a little off balanced (in a fun way?) I noticed myself sometimes not standing up or walking straight but I also wasn't falling over, I was easily entertained and my attention span was longer than it normally is, and I didn't get the munchies at all (which is a good thing in my opinion.) The nugs were dense, the perfect amount of sticky, green with a little bit of red, frosty, tasted like fresh air from a nice forest or something like it, and has a strong (and good) scent that smells mostly sweet but with a hint of something tangy. My tolerance has gone up throughout the years so I usually smoke at least 1-2 bowls (depending on the potency) or take 3-4 decent sized snappers from my bong; but with the Fire OG I packed the bowl half way and snapped it (burnt it slowly and thoroughly and cleared the bong all in one hit) and I got just as high as I do when I smoke my normal amount. If you haven't tried some of this yet I highly recommend it! It's the perfect balance between indica and sativa highs. PS. I got it from Spot 35 Cap in Pacoima.
