This strain is a cross between the omnipresent Girl Scout Cookies and the flavorful and eye-catching Granddaddy Purple. This background gives the flowers a relaxing high and a complex, fruity taste. Although it\u2019s known to be a potent variety, cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found Monster Cookies to have a modest range of 10% to 15% THC composition. This strain is distinguished by medium-sized nugs that hold their shape thanks to a dense indica-type bud structure. The sticky and tightly-coiled leaves are predominantly forest green, but are accentuated by deep blue and purple hues -- these vibrant colors are the result of pigments called anthocyanins being stimulated by cold temperatures in the growing process. Short-talked white trichomes give the bright buds a frosty overlay; they also make this a difficult strain to break up by hand. Monster Cookies has a mostly berry and grape-tinged flavor profile, much like parent strain Granddaddy Purple. Breaking up or burning the buds gives off more of a spicy, incense-like quality, compliments of the OG Kush in this strain\u2019s lineage. Cured properly, it has a smooth, easy smoke that tastes dank and sweet on the exhale. This is also a particularly pungent strain, so smokers trying to keep their consumption under wraps should take the necessary precautions. Monster Cookies has a high that creeps up on the user, slowly conferring a heavy body stone. The temptation to melt into the nearest possible couch may prove overwhelming for many. Although some cerebral stimulation may occur, this strain\u2019s mental qualities are mostly dictated by its deep physical relaxation. Smokers will feel fully at ease -- content to remain in one place, but uplifted enough to be social and chatty. Because of these trippy, dreamy qualities, Monster Cookies is probably not the best choice for those looking to accomplish work or finish errands. Because of this strain\u2019s potency, cannabis newcomers should moderate their initial dosage and then scale up if necessary. Its almost narcotic effects gives Monster Cookies strong analgesic effects for medical cannabis patients. It can be an effective way to relieve aches and pains -- both incidental from injury or soreness and chronic from conditions like fibromyalgia. It has also been said to soothe headaches and migraines and, in large enough doses, can help users with insomnia to find deep, lasting sleep. Seeds of Monster Cookies are not commercially available; as such, those looking to grow this strain must obtain clippings from mature plants in order to grow identical \u201cclones.\u201d It can be successfully cultivated indoors or out, although outdoor growing requires Mediterranean-like climates with some humidity and daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Monster Cookies\u2019 plants, like those of many other indica varieties, grow short and bushy with a wide lateral branching system. Growers should look to \u201ctop\u201d their plants by trimming any high-growing fan leaves in order to let light and air break through to the dense lower branches. Those looking to bring out the full colorful potential of this strain\u2019s buds should also activate its anthocyanin pigments by exposing the plants to cold weather just before flowering occurs. Monster Cookies flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late September or early October when grown outdoors. Although it only offers growers an average yield, its flowers are typically large and may need to be held up by makeshift stakes in order to keep from drooping on their branches. After the long process of cultivation, growers should also properly cure their flowers of Monster Cookies to preserve their potency and bold flavor. Monster Cookies is a great example of the genetic bounty that the phenomenally popular Girl Scout Cookies continues to yield. It\u2019s a quintessential nighttime smoke whose heavy and dreamy high is best enjoyed alone or with a small group of familiar friends. This flower\u2019s fruity, crowd-pleasing taste and its powerful sedative high may mark it as a new favorite for indica fans.

Created by breeders Exotic Genetix, this strain is a cross between two hybrids: pungent Starfighter and an unnamed one of the many different phenotypes of Girl Scout Cookies. Although Cookies and Cream can lean sativa or indica depending on the pheno, it provides an ideal combination of both cerebral and physical effects. This flavorful flower took First Prize in the 2014 High Times Cannabis Cup for Best U.S. Hybrid. Cannabis laboratory Analytics 360 has consistently found flowers of Cookies and Cream to have a THC composition of 20% to an impressive 25%. Buds of Cookies and Cream are small to medium-sized and do not typically adhere in large, chunky clusters. When properly cured, the flowers appear medium to dark green, and yellow pistils are threaded in and out of the densely-packed leaves. Icy white trichomes dot the flowers, making buds only slightly sticky and still easy to break apart. Cookies and Cream\u2019s name promises a dessert-like flavor profile -- and with a sweet, vaguely vanilla scent, these flowers don\u2019t disappoint. There\u2019s also a hint of sourness that may remind smoke aficionados of staple strain Cheese. When burnt, this strain hits easily with a very smooth smoke. Users may notice a creamy mouthfeel on the inhale. Cookies and Cream leaves a nutty, toasted flavor when exhaled. Parent strain Starfighter also imparts some lingering skunkiness, so any smokers trying to keep their consumption secret should take the necessary precautions. This strain has a high that mounts gradually, beginning as a dizzy lightheadedness and progressing towards full body relaxation. While they savor Cookies and Cream\u2019s taste, users may begin to notice a pressure around the temples. Rather than analytical and intense, the mental effects of this strain seem to have more to do with mood. Euphoric feelings may set in, along with intensified sensory perception. These psychedelic sensations are matched by a weightiness in the head and limbs which, if not totally incapacitating, at leaves smokers feeling somewhat lazy. Thorough relaxation is the name of the game here, complented by a kind of dreamy mental stimulation. Cookies and Cream\u2019s semi-narcotic effects make it a great medical strain for a range of physical ailments. Aches, pains, and soreness can melt away even with relatively small doses. In larger doses, this flower can also combat insomnia, lulling users into deep, heavy sleep. Cookies and Cream can also help temporarily relieve some of the troubling symptoms of stress and anxiety disorders, minimizing worries and uplifting mood. Dry mouth, red eyes, and a persistent tightness around the eyes are commonly reported as negative side effects. Since this is a potent crossbreed, a small amount goes a long way, even for more experienced users. Cookies and Cream is typically a difficult, temperamental strain to grow and is not recommended for first-time cultivators. Although it\u2019s lesser-known and clones may be hard to come by, breeders Exotic Genetix have fortunately made seeds of Cookies and Cream available for sale. This plant can be successfully grown indoors or outdoors, but outdoor growing requires warm and semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climates, with daytime temperatures in the 70 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. Grown indoors, plants reach medium height; any taller phenotypes can be trained to fit within their grow space if their branches are bent and pruned early on in the vegetative stage. Growers should also top their plants by regulating trimming any light-blocking fan leaves in order to encourage lower nodes to give maximum yield. Cookies and Cream has a very short flowering time -- grown indoors, plants are ready for harvest within 8 to 9 weeks. A well-rounded strain that won\u2019t leave you either too couchlocked or too paranoid to function, Cookies and Cream is a great option for any time of day. It\u2019s equally enjoyable in social and solo settings, as long as smokers are in a relaxed setting and maintain a positive outlook.

Established staple hybrids Girl Scout Cookies and Blueberry unite to yield this tasty flower with a focused and clearheaded but very relaxed high. Said to be a potent smoke even for cannabis veterans, Blue Cookies has a THC composition that ranges from 20% to an impressive 25%. Note that there is a different (albeit similar) strain called Blue Cookies on the market that is a distinct phenotype of Girl Scout Cookies itself rather than a cross between GSC and Blueberry. Blue Cookies\u2019 buds are big and chunky with a dense structure more typical of indica varieties. The leaves clump together in slightly long, conical shapes that are threaded through with red to fiery orange pistils. Like parent strain Blueberry, Blue Cookies is marked by particularly colorful flowers: they appear spring green and more often than not are flecked with blue and purple hues. These latter colors emerge when high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins are stimulated by cold temperatures in the growing process. Cloudy trichomes cover the already-colorful leaves, giving them a silvery sheen. The high resin content also makes Blue Cookies a hard strain to break up for pipes or joints without the use of a grinder. Blue Cookies has bold flavors to match its visual appeal. Users will notice a simultaneously fruity and dank smell from the cured buds that feels like a combination of Blueberry\u2019s berry and GSC\u2019s earthy profiles. Breaking or burning the flowers brings out a rich smell that is more reminiscent of leather. The smoke hits very smoothly and carries a slight taste of cherry with some skunk on the exhale. Interestingly, despite its purple coloration, Blue Cookies does not have a detectable grape flavor -- this is because the same anthocyanin pigments that dictate the strain\u2019s color do not have a corresponding effect on its taste. As with many evenly-balanced hybrids, Blue Cookies takes hold first in the head, with a quick and possibly disorienting rush. This initial buzz soon spreads throughout the body just as smokers notice a change in perception of their surroundings. This merging of head and body high is stimulating but not overwhelming, keeping users grounded and able to bend the experience to fit their surroundings. Blue Cookies is as enjoyable out on a walk or a hike as it is for a night on the couch. This strain\u2019s stimulation of both brain and both also makes it great for activities that involve both -- it can be a good exercise aid and even an aphrodisiac. Similarly, Blue Cookies has value as a medical treatment for both physical and psychological afflictions. Its sense of lucidity and focus can be great for patients with attention deficit disorders. It can also have powerful effects on depressed or anxious mood, providing anything from mellow contentment to euphoria. Somatic relaxation makes Blue Cookies a good analgesic treatment for aches, pains, and nausea. In high enough concentrations, this can help insomniacs find deep and restful sleep. Despite its potent and well-rounded high, authenticated seeds of Blue Cookies can be hard to come by. Prospective growers may need to obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain in order to grow healthy clones. Once procured, Blue Cookies can be grown indoors or outdoors, although outdoor growing calls for a moderate to warm climate with consistent daytime temperatures in the 70 to 74 degree Fahrenheit range. Indoor growing conditions can be more deliberately controlled, and the short to medium-height plants can take well to limited spaces -- especially if growers do some limited bending and pruning early in the vegetative stage. Growers should also regularly trim away the broad fan leaves that grow at the top of plants in order to let light and air reach the lower flowering nodes. Bringing out this strain\u2019s signature colors requires \u201cshocking\u201d the plant by exposing it to some colder than average temperatures just before flowering begins. Blue Cookies flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors, at which point growers may need to provide artificial supports like wooden dowels to keep the thick buds from weighing down branches. This strain offers an average yield of flowers. If you can come by it, Blue Cookies offers a great taste and a crowd-pleasing, well-balanced high.

LVPK\u2019s buds are small to medium-sized and dense, although not as sticky as those of other Indica strains. True to its Purple Kush name, it produces leaves that are green with varying shades of purple. The scent is primarily fruity, with hints of grapes and berries.

On the exhale, LVPK has a vaguely musky taste. LVPK is heavily sedative, even for more experienced users. The high begins as a lightheaded rush that gradually spreads throughout the body. Users report feelings of extreme calm and a floating sensation. This strain\u2019s cerebral effects tend to be limited to a perception of the strong and long-lasting body melt. Because of its potent physical effects, LVPK is useful for stress, chronic pain, and especially insomnia. Because of its shorter, bushy plants, LVPK makes a convenient indoor grow.

It has a mostly sativa head high with some subtle physical indica relaxation, making it popular among recreational and medical users alike. This is a potent strain, with a THC content that had been measured at between 20% and 25%. Because the underground cannabis market of the 1980s and 90s operated without any kind of lasting documentation, the exact origins of Sour Diesel are not known. Although a definitive agreement on its original genetic makeup doesn't exist, Sour Diesel\u2019s popularity has made it the subject of much speculation. Some believe that true Sour Diesel was derived as a distinct phenotype of an original strain simply named Diesel. Others say that it was a phenotype of Chemdawg\u00a0that leaned more sativa than indica. Still others claim that it was a cross of Chemdawg and Northern Lights, or perhaps Chemdawg, Northern Lights and Skunk #1. Sour Diesel has round, medium-sized buds with leaves that appear yellowish-green. Red hairs called pistils, structures that operate to catch pollen from male plants, contrast with the densely-packed leaves. When properly cured, the flowers are somewhat sticky -- the dusting of trichomes is not as immediately obvious as it is on more resinous strains like White Widow. Nevertheless, breaking open buds reveals trichomes coating the insides of the dense flowers. The buds have an overpowering smell that, true to this strain\u2019s name, is very similar to gasoline. The odor also has some hints of orange. Breaking open or grinding the buds intensifies this scent, and adds components of musk and pine sap. Sour Diesel has a notoriously harsh, acrid smoke that can cause users to cough or make their sinuses water. The smoke has a sour and vaguely skunky taste that may describe as unpleasant; on the exhale, the diesel and almost ammonia-like tang stings the palate and may linger for a long time afterward. Smokers trying to remain discreet should be warned that this is a very pungent strain whose odor can carry for quite a distance. The high from Sour Diesel comes on users quickly in the form of a warm and pleasant head rush. An uplift in mood may be noticeable as well. Although Sour Diesel stimulates synaptic activity in the brain, the character of this head high is more spacey than intensely cerebral. Users may feel chatty if surrounded by others or somewhat introspective if enjoying the strain alone. For many, this soaring high is partially anchored by a slight feeling of physical relaxation. That said, a body stone that leads to full-on couchlock is rare. The sense of euphoria that comes with this variety may be helpful in treating some symptoms of mild stress, anxiety, or depression. Its tendency to lead to associative thinking may provoke a bit of creative inspiration. Fans of the strain also describe relief from troublesome aches and pains. Sour Diesel\u2019s combination of mental and somatic effects may also make it a potent aphrodisiac in certain situations. As is common with many strong sativas, the altered mental state brought about by Sour Diesel may prove overwhelming for some, leading to paranoid, recursive thinking or a feeling of being generally \u201cout of control\u201d of one\u2019s thoughts or body. As such, users -- especially those with a lower THC tolerance -- should adjust their intake accordingly. Sour Diesel has an average-length high that lasts about 2 to 3 hours. Seeds of Sour Diesel are packaged and available for sale from several seed bank retailers. Growers can also raise plants as clones, taking clippings taken from fully grown plants of the same strain. Sour Diesel can be grown indoors or outdoors, although outdoor cultivation requires semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climates with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The plants are more characteristically sativa than indica, with a tall, spindly appearance and large spaces between flowering nodes. Plants can grow to be over four feet tall, with their height increasing exponentially during the flowering stage. For those growing indoors, bending and pruning branches early in the vegetative stage may help train the plants to fit within limited vertical space. Sour Diesel flowers within 10 weeks when grown indoors and around early November when grown outdoors. It has a moderately high yield: growers can expect between 42 and 56 grams (or between 1.5 and 2 ounces) per square foot of plant. Sour Diesel\u2019s energized and positive high makes it easy to see why the strain enjoys popularity across the United States. It has spawned popular and flavorful strains like Sour Tsunami and Sour Jack and inspired strains like NYC Diesel, which imitates its unique taste.

In the 60s, when Maui Waui was bred, the THC content of an average marijuana strain was quite low (almost always under 8%). Maui Waui featured THC content well into the teens and quickly became one of the most desired strains available. These days, it is considered to be a middle to high grade medication that provides a typical Sativa high with a few Indica perks. Other strains (along with new hybrids) have caught up and even surpassed this legendary strain in THC content. Frequent users of Maui Waui report a happy and energetic high that can also increase creativity. It provides a light and pleasant body numbing sensation as well as a strong case of the stereotypical 'munchies.'\u00a0Users may expect dry eyes and mouth and possible paranoia.

Maui Waui's Indica side may be useful for easing minor chronic aches and pains. It is also used to stimulate appetite in those with anorexia and other eating disorders. Some users also use Maui Waui as medication for chronic migraine. Maui Waui originated as an outdoor grow on the island of Maui and almost immediately spread to all the Hawaiian Islands. Unfortunately the strain's exact genetics are not known. The plants of this strain show their true heritage in their height, usually reaching around 175 centimeters.

It is a three-way cross between an indica Afghani parent and sativa Thai and Purple Thai variant parents. Blueberry was originally developed in the 1970s or 80s by DJ Short, a mysterious but prolific breeder who\u2019s been dubbed the \"Willy Wonka of pot.\u201d\u00a0Blueberry is distinguished by an unmistakable fresh blueberry smell and taste that have made it an enduring favorite. Blueberry is popular nationwide. It won top marks in the 2000 High Times Cannabis Cup for Best Indica and best strain overall. Blueberry has a THC content that ranges between 15% and 24%. Flowers of this strain are small and densely-packed, as one might expect of an indica-dominant variety. The compact forest green leaves are often flecked with traces of purple and red. These latter colors develop due to high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins in this strain\u2019s genetics -- as the plants are exposed to colder than average temperatures during the growing period, these pigments are activated, bringing out colorful hues. The leaves are coated in almost transparent trichomes, which may be harder to see than that milky or amber-colored glands covering similarly resinous strains. Nevertheless, buds of Blueberry are very sticky and may be difficult to break up by hand without the use of a grinder. This strain\u2019s bag appeal isn\u2019t just limited to its eye-catching hues -- when cured properly, the flowers immediately give off an aroma of fresh blueberries. This sweet and slightly tart smell bears some resemblance to the odor of the Purple Thai parent strain. Breaking open buds of Blueberry gives off some more complex scents of spice and musk, reminiscent of Afghani varieties. When buds are directly combusted, some skunkiness is evident. Smoke is surprisingly smooth for an indica, and has a sweet blueberry taste on inhale and exhale with no lingering funk. Often described as a \u201cone hit and quit\u201d strain, Blueberry is notably potent, even for experienced cannabis enthusiasts. Users are quickly struck with a sense of physical heaviness that may be disorienting in situations that require mobility or coordination. In relaxed settings, this physical sensation can translate into a therapeutic calmness, allowing users to unwind after a long day or week of work. The sativa genetics confer some slight mental effects, but these take the form of euphoric uplift more than of cerebral thoughtfulness; smokers may feel chatty or even giggly. In high enough doses, Blueberry will leave users heavy and couchlocked -- this is not an ideal strain for productivity and is better suited to tranquil evening use. Medically speaking, Blueberry has almost narcotic properties. It is of use to those with pain conditions -- both short-term pain due to injury or exercise or long-term chronic pain related to disease or nerve damage. It can also help relieve some of the troubling symptoms of stress, anxiety and PTSD, creating a physical relaxation strong enough to ease a racing, pre-occupied mind. Most notably, Blueberry can induce a deep and lasting sleep and therefore serve as an antidote to entrenched insomnia. Side effects of this strain include the typical dry mouth and red eyes. Its heaviness can also result in droopy, unfocused eyes. As noted, a little bit of Blueberry goes a long way and its high is said to last longer than average. Blueberry can be grown as a clone, if clippings are taken from mature and healthy plants. Growers can also buy seeds. Creator DJ Short has legal claim to the \u201cancestral and parental breeding stock and intellectual development rights\u201d -- but the nature of the cannabis market is such that DJ Short has no control over his seeds once they\u2019ve been sold, meaning that competitors like Dutch Passion are free to experiment with Blueberry\u2019s genetics and sell their own proprietary seeds under the same name. Blueberry can be grown indoors or outdoors, but outdoor growing demands restrictive conditions like moderate humidity and consistent daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants are well-suited to indoor cultivation, as they grow short and bushy -- rarely exceeding 3.5 feet in height -- with strong lateral branching. They also have a very favorable leaf-to-bud ratio, meaning that they require minimal trimming of broad fan leaves. Growers looking to bring out the vibrant lavender to red accents in Blueberry\u2019s leaves should artificially \u201cshock\u201d the plant by introducing cold temperatures late in vegetative stage, just before flowering. \u00a0Plants flowers within 8 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and are ready for harvest in mid October outdoors. When mature, Blueberry has a moderate to high yield, offering about 1.5 ounces of flower per square foot of plant. Perfect for mellow nighttime use, Blueberry is a great choice for those looking to unwind alone or with an intimate group of familiar friends. Its combination of restorative physical relaxation with a mildly hazy head high is matched by standout flavors.

On the exhale, smoke tastes vaguely hashy and spicy, perhaps evidence of Afghani in its lineage. Despite mostly indica physical characteristics, Green Crack has a strong and buzzy sativa high. \u00a0It provides users with a boost of energy that soon manifests as a cerebral mindset, making this an excellent wake and bake strain. Green Crack\u2019s potency can make mundane like dishes and laundry tasks more interesting. It\u2019s also an inspiring smoke -- its sharp sense of focus can help users zero in on creative projects or can draw attention to the nuances in a piece of music or a movie. Green Crack can also have some slightly psychedelic effects, including visual distortions and, particularly, an odd sense of time dilation. Because it can leave users feeling uplifted and fairly wired, this strain isn\u2019t recommended for use late at night. Because it doesn\u2019t have many physically relaxing indica properties, Green Crack doesn\u2019t have a wide range of medical benefits. However, its energizing effects can be great for freeing users from fatigue. Green Crack can also aid those suffering from anxiety and depression, helping them to live in the moment -- although in large enough doses, the tendency towards recursive cerebral thinking can plunge some into panic or paranoia. Green Crack is a relatively easy strain to grow, and a good choice for newcomers to cultivation. It can flourish indoors or out, although outdoor growing requires a stable source of sunlight and consistent temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It\u2019s more easily grown indoors where conditions can be controlled. Plants can reach between 3 and 4 feet tall with strong lateral branching. Growers should practice \u201ctopping\u201d when growing these plants, which involves trimming broad leaves at the top of the plant to allow light to reach the lower stalks and produce as many buds as possible. Green Crack flowers relatively quickly for a sativa, reaching maturity between 7 and 8 weeks when grown inside and ready for harvest in October when grown outdoors. The yield is average but solid, producing about 41 to 46 grams (or about 1.4 to 1.6 ounces) per square footage of plant. Growers should also take care to properly cure the harvested buds in order to preserve Green Crack\u2019s taste and potency -- curing involves first drying the buds by hanging them upside down for about a week in a room that maintains 50% humidity and a consistent temperature of 70 degree Fahrenheit and then sealing the dried buds in wide-mouthed jars in ambient surroundings of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and between 60-65% humidity. Despite the edginess of its name, Green Crack is more likely to make users energized and inspired than strung out and manic. Providing the best of what sativa varieties have to offer, it\u2019s a great strain for enhancing your appreciation of your surroundings or simply as a way to help you get up and go. It\u2019s also unique in its potency -- even for more experienced cannabis fans, a little bit of this controlled substance can go a long way."], "attributes": {"anxiety": 60, "pain": 20, "energetic": 100, "euphoric": 80, "creative": 60, "paranoia": 20, "appetite": 20, "cotton mouth": 40, "depression": 100, "nausea": 80}}], "haarlem": [{"source": "FOURTWENTY101", "kind": [50, 50, 1], "description": "Gage Green Group seed\\'s, \"Haarlem\" is a super frosty hybrid variety that shares the genetics of two well-rounded plants from complete opposite sides of the board.

Commercial breeders Barney\u2019s Farm, Apothecary Genetics, and the Seattle-based Royal Tree Gardens all lay claim to this strain\u2019s creation. Despite its uncertain provenance, though, sources agree that Grape Royale builds on the Afghani and Skunk #1 cross utilized by Royal Kush and adds the famous Northern California favorite Mendocino Purple. The result is a bold and tasty flower that confers lasting indica relaxation suited to nighttime use. Popular in the Pacific Northwest, Grape Royale has a reported average THC composition of 18%. Grape Royale has the dense, heavy buds you\u2019d expect of a landrace-descended indica; a sturdy grinder may be needed to break apart its tightly coiled flowers. Leaves are mostly a pale sea green. As much as its cousin strain Royal Kush has hints of purple, Grape Royale has even deeper violet hues, thanks to the influence of parent strain Mendocino Purple. This intensified color is thanks to a high concentration of pigments called anthocyanins, which produce blue to purple hues when agitated by cold weather in the growing process. You might expect Grape Royale to have a strong and immediate grape scent, but any fruitiness in the flowers plays second fiddle to a deep hashy funk, inherited from grandparent strains Afghani and Skunk. Breaking open or combusting the buds also yields a sour citrus aroma. With its strong indica roots, Grape Royale provides potent and lasting relaxation. This isn\u2019t an especially cerebral strain, but what users may lose in focus and motivation, they gain in relief from tension and worry. As the high progresses -- or if greater quantities are consumed -- this strain can even send users into couchlock, causing them to melt into their surroundings. Grape Royale\u2019s sedative qualities make it valuable to medical cannabis patients -- its body stone can block needling aches and pains, dull the troubling symptoms of stress and anxiety, and, in large enough doses, resolve stubborn cases of insomnia. As this remains a relatively uncommon strain outside of the U.S. West Coast market, information on growing Grape Royale remains limited. That said, we can infer some likely markers of its cultivation from its popular parent strains. Seeds of Grape Royale are not yet available for commercial sale, so prospective growers will need to obtain clippings from mature plants in order to grow identical \u201cclones.\u201d Like many other strains, it can be grown indoors or outdoors, although outdoor cultivation calls for a warm, Mediterranean-like climate. Grape Royale is likely more manageable indoors; the closely-related Royal Kush and Mendocino Purps plants reach maximum heights of 3 to 4 feet. Growers will want to \u201ctop off,\u201d or trim any large light-blocking leaves to encourage growth of low-growing flower nodes. Perhaps most importantly, growers should also bring out this strain\u2019s full purple potential by \u201cshocking\u201d the plants, exposing them to cold temperatures late in the growing process -- although it\u2019s important to note that opting to skip this step won\u2019t affect flavor; Grape Royale\u2019s grape taste is determined by its terpenes, not the pigments that dictate its color. Grown indoors, this strain has a short flowering period of 7 to 8 weeks. After successfully growing Grape Royale, cultivators should also take the time to cure their flowers. First, hang the buds upside down or lay them on drying racks for 7 to 10 days; the surrounding humidity should be 50% and the temperature about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Once stems snap off of the flowers relatively easily, seal the buds in airtight wide-mouthed jars in ambient humidity of 60-65% and temperature around 70 degrees.

Named for the late Kimbo Slice, a larger than life mixed martial arts fighter and boxer, this strain was created by the prolific Exotic Genetix, the same breeders who gave us the tasty Cookies and Cream. Kimbo Kush is a cross between Blackberry Kush and indica heavy hitter Starfighter. It\u2019s known to be a strong and spacey painkiller for cannabis novices and aficionados alike. Cannabis testing laboratory Analytical 360 has found flowers of Kimbo Kush to have between 15.5% and an impressive 27% THC content. True to its namesake, Kimbo Kush has large, chunky buds that hold a relatively loose and fluffy bud structure for an indica-dominant strain. Its leaves are predominantly a pale spring green; some phenotypes show shades of purple. This latter color comes about during the growing process when unusually cold weather stimulates pigments (called anthocyanins) in the plant -- the process is similar to the way foliage changes color in autumn. These colorful flowers are thickly coated in trichomes, giving the cured buds an icy sheen and making them very sticky to the touch. Deep and fruity notes of citrus and berry waft up from the flowers. There\u2019s also a trace of dank earth, courtesy of grandparent strain OG Kush. When combusted, Kimbo Kush has a remarkably smooth smoke for an indica that tastes sour at first but carries a fruity flavor on the exhale. This particularly pungent strain has a lingering funk, and smokers looking to maintain discretion should take some precautions. Kimbo Kush creeps up slowly, sometimes taking several minutes before hitting users with its thorough relaxation. Smokers may initially feel an increased heaviness in their head and limbs, inspiring them to sit down if they aren\u2019t already doing so. Contended sluggishness follows: users may feel perfectly happy to stay put listening to music or watching TV. Although there may be some psychedelic effects like amplified sounds or time dilation, Kimbo Kush primarily acts on the body, leaving the mind pleasantly foggy. These almost narcotic effects may be as medically effective as they are recreationally entertaining. This strain has the ability to dull chronic aches and pains and to blunt the acute symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. In large enough doses, it can even be a quick fix for stubborn insomnia. Kimbo Kush is suited to evening and bedtime use. Those consuming during the day should plan on lolling away a few unproductive hours. This is known to be a potent strain, even for experienced smokers; any users should wait a few minutes for the high to take hold before amping up their dosage. Seeds of Kimbo Kush are available for purchase online from Exotic Genetix; prospective growers can also try and obtain clippings to grow as \u201cclones,\u201d although for the time being, this seems to be a difficult strain to come by. Kimbo Kush can be grown outdoors in climates with consistent daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It may be more successful indoors, where growers can meticulously control temperature and humidity. As is typical of indica varieties, this strain\u2019s plants grow squat and bushy, with broad leaves and strong lateral branches. Growers should be sure to trim any light-blocking fan leaves in order to let light and air reach the lower flowering nodes. Growers looking to increase their crop\u2019s bag appeal should bring out this strain\u2019s subtle purple accents by artificially \u201cshocking\u201d the plants, exposing them to cold temperatures just before flowering begins. Finally, Kimbo Kush is as pungent during the growing phase as it is when it\u2019s smoked, so cultivators trying to keep their grow operations secret should install odor control measures like exhaust fans. With a complex taste and a powerful, enduring high, Kimbo Kush is the perfect choice for some mellow alone time or for a low-key get together with familiar friends. Better enjoyed after dark than consumed as a wake-and-bake strain, it\u2019s great for unwinding after a long day. This strain\u2019s high concentrations of THC can deliver a knockout sedative punch that Kimbo Slice himself would be proud to claim as a legacy. \u00a0"], "attributes": {"anxiety": 100, "insomnia": 20, "relaxed": 100, "sleepy": 40, "euphoric": 80, "appetite": 80, "dry eyes": 20, "cotton mouth": 20, "depression": 100, "nausea": 60}}], "odins hammer": [{"source": "QANNABIS", "kind": [0, 0, -1], "description": "\\xa0", "attributes": {}}], "wonder haze": [{"source": "QANNABIS", "kind": [0, 0, -1], "description": "\\xa0", "attributes": {}}], "fire alien urkle": [{"source": "FOURTWENTY101", "kind": [100, 0, 1], "description": "This absolutely beautiful Indica dominant hybrid known as, \"Fire Alien Urkle\" is a dark purple colored hybrid variety that was brought forth by non-other than OG Raskal himself.

It is a cross between the \u201cKatsu cut\u201d of Bubba Kush (a distinct phenotype named for the breeder who discovered it) and Rare Dankness\u2019 eponymous strain Rare Dankness #2. The result is a subtly flavored but potent flower that lulls users into a state of full-bodied relaxation. Cornbread has THC levels that range from 15% to 20%. Cornbread\u2019s flowers are small to medium sized and marked by tight, solid buds that betray a typically indica structure. The leaves are a vibrant green, and contrast with rust-colored hairs which are actually the flower\u2019s pistils, intended to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants. Certain phenotypes of Cornbread have shades of purple as well. This latter color is the result of high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins being activated by cool temperatures in the growing process. These colorful buds are entirely coated by trichomes, making them extremely sticky to the touch. This strain has an indefinable herbal scent, with some sharp hints of citrus lurking underneath. Breaking open the resinous flowers shows off some dank, earthy odors -- evidence of the influence of Kush in this strain\u2019s genetics. With an uncommonly smooth smoke, Cornbread tastes spicy and lemony on the exhale; the overall impression is that of a cup of strong tea, and not of any recognizable variety of cornbread. It\u2019s also worth noting that the pigments that give this strain its eye-popping purple hues do not have any effect on its taste -- users expecting a grape flavor profile may be disappointed. Double-bag this strain if carrying it in public, as it tends to be very pugnent. More of a midnight treat than a wake and bake breakfast or an evening appetizer, Cornbread has mostly physical effects. Its effects may be slow to take hold, but once they do, they can engender confusion and a kind of brain fog. Smokers may be hit with a temporary pressure in the eyes and sinuses. In comfortable surroundings though, this trippy feeling soon melts into a corporal heaviness. Users can cast off stress and tension and submit to this strain\u2019s powerful body stone. Depending on individual tolerance, couchlock is common and can go so far as to endow consumers with the psychedelic feeling of being disconnected from their own bodies. Cornbread has little tendency towards cerebral, analytical thinking, leaving users agreeable -- albeit not particularly chatty. Definitely not a strain that will aid productivity, Cornbread is better suited to taking the edge off after a long day. Cornbread\u2019s heavy sedative effects make it a clear choice for medical cannabis patients with a range of ailments. Its sense of oblivion can create temporary relief from depression, anxiety, or PTSD. It can ease deep-seated aches and pains and can even be an effective treatment for insomnia. Although the risk of negative side effects is relatively low, this strain\u2019s ability to immobilize users could induce some paranoia or panic if it\u2019s consumed in public or in a situation where tasks need to be accomplished. Rare Dankness sells packaged seeds of Cornbread for any prospective growers. Like many other strains, Cornbread could conceivably be grown in or outdoors, although outdoor cultivation calls for a balmy and semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Plants grow short and bushy, and users should be sure to tend to lower branches, trimming any high-growing fan leaves that prevent light and air from reaching flowering nodes at the base. Growers who\u2019d like to bring out this strain\u2019s purple potential should also artificially \u201cshock\u201d the plants by exposing them to colder than average temperatures just before the flowering stage. Cornbread flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and offers growers a high yield. As noted, this is a pungent variety -- those looking to keep their growing operations discreet should put odor control measures like carbon air filters in place.

So named because it doubles down on Blue Dream, Double Dream is a cross between Blue Dream itself and Dream Star (which is sativa-dominant cross between Blue Dream and Stardawg). The result is a fruity sativa-dominant hybrid with a mellow, balanced high that will indeed leave you dreamy. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found flowers of Double Dream to have an average THC content of 20%. Buds of Double Dream have a bud structure that is thick and dense, showing the influence of its indica genetics -- but its soft and fluffy leaves lean sativa and are more wispy than tightly coiled in on themselves. The flowers are light to vibrant green in color and, like Blue Dream, do not show the blue-purple hues so often associated with grandparent strain Blueberry. Orange hairs -- which are actually pistils, intended to catch pollen from male pants -- stand out against the monochromatic leaves. A silvery coating of trichomes covers the buds and renders them very sticky; this variety is very hard to break apart without a grinder. When cured properly, the most prominent scent of Double Dream is tangy blueberry. The fruity odors are undercut by some spice and funk as well. The smoke from this strain is known to be harsh when burnt with a hash-like fragrance. Exhaled, Double Dream taste sweet with some herbal notes. This strain is said to take hold slowly -- it may be 15 minutes before some users feel the full effects. A strong buzz moves gradually down from the head and spreads throughout the body, culminating in a comfortable meld between physical and mental relaxation. Although Double Dream leans sativa, its effect on the brain takes the form of rambling creative inspiration more so than cerebral stimulation. Thoughts may be elevated or feel particularly significant, but have a hazy, dreamlike quality that make this a great strain to enjoy during a lazy afternoon or a weekday evening. Smokers may feel open to suggestion and able to enjoy a wide range of activities. Medically speaking, Double Dream can be useful in relieving incidental aches and pains, due to injury or strenuous exercise. It has also been described an effective painkiller for inflammation due to chronic disease and nerve damage. These same narcotic properties may also have the ability to dull troubling headaches. In large enough amounts, Double Dream can induce a deep and restful sleep, aiding those who suffer from insomnia. This strain\u2019s mental effects can also confer some medical benefits -- its mild euphoria makes it a great option for those with anxiety and mood disorders. Despite its famous genetics and its easy appeal, seeds of Double Dream are not commercially available. Those who wish to grow this hybrid must obtain clippings from healthy, mature plants in order to grow clones. The plants take their cues from Blue Dream. They can be grown outdoors in humid, Mediterranean-like climates, and are especially resistant to mildew. That said, this strain can also be vulnerable to some insects. Double Dream\u2019s plants grow short and bushy with wide lateral branches, making them easy to grow indoors as well. Growers should \u201ctop\u201d plants in the vegetative stage by trimming light-blocking fan leaves at the tops of plants in order to allow encourage growth of buds on lower branches. This variety flowers within a relatively short 8 weeks when grown indoors. Double Dream can also be pungent as it grows -- those trying to keep their grow operations discreet should invest in odor-control measures like exhaust fans or carbon air filters. Double Dream suggests that more of a good thing isn\u2019t always a bad thing -- the extra dose of Blue Dream in its genetics makes this a doubly tasty and relaxing smoke. Its ideal balance of mellow bodily effects and thoughtfulness can be enjoyed at any time of day. This strain\u2019s flavor is also great to share with friends -- or with friendly strangers as an icebreaker.

This sativa-leaning hybrid was created by seed company The Cali Connection as a cross between Tahoe OG Kush (itself a phenotype of the original OG Kush) and Cali Connection\u2019s very own indica Alien Kush. \u00a0Alien OG offers a soaring psychedelic high with roughly equal parts cerebral stimulation and and physical relaxation. Alien OG\u2019s THC content can range from 20% to as much as 28%. Buds of Alien OG are packaged as small, nugget-like clusters. Although the flowers often have a dense, compact bud structure, some phenotypes lean more sativa and have looser, fluffier leaves. The leaves themselves appear light green and are offset by orange to vibrant red pistils, which are structures that allow the female plants to catch pollen for fertilization. As evidenced by their high THC content, flowers of Alien OG are resinous, covered in trichomes that make them appear moist and frosty. This strain has a surprisingly sweet, citrus-like smell, with notes of lemon wafting up from the cured buds. There are also more subtle notes of earth and fresh pine. When combusted, flowers give off a more spicy, hashy scent typical of the OG family. The smoke is lung-expanding but very smooth. Smokers may taste hashy incense and a faint tang of ammonia on the exhale. This is one pungent strain, and its odor can linger for a while after it\u2019s smoked; this might not be the right choice for any smokers trying to keep their consumption discreet. The high from Alien OG is said to come on quickly as a bracing pressure behind the eyes. This head rush is accompanied by a sudden change in cognition, as thoughts race in rapid-fire association. The intensity of this cerebral effect is often determined by user\u2019s set and setting or by their individual tolerance. In cases where a smoker is able to comfortably settle into Alien OG\u2019s altered state, the high can take on psychedelic proportions: visual distortions like enhanced colors or peripheral flashes can happen, as can the trippy sensation of time moving more slowly. Physical relaxation sets in as the high progresses, or as users consume greater amounts. This strain can be as energetic or as relaxing as smokers intend -- as easily enjoyed out among friends as it is vegging out alone. Alien OG\u2019s well-rounded high also lends itself to several medical applications. Its euphoria can be a boost for those struggling with depression, while its ever-present cerebral nature can be grounding and mindful for those with stress, anxiety, or PTSD. Its palpable body stone, while not immobilizing, can be helpful in relieving chronic aches and pains and even nausea. In high enough doses, Alien OG can even be an effective means of banishing insomnia and lulling users into a deep, refreshing sleep. Because of its \u201cracey\u201d properties, however, this strain can sometimes lead to a kind of paranoid, recursive thinking for smokers who are inexperienced or prone to anxiety. Alien OG\u2019s creators at Cali Connection have made seeds of the strain available for sale. It is a moderately difficult grow, and may not be the best for newcomers to cultivation. Better grown indoors than out, this strain is known to have trouble developing a root system, and may require potting with rockwool and a significant amount of nutrients when first planted. The short, bushy plants may also require topping, by trimming large fan leaves in order to allow light and air to reach flowering nodes on the lower branches. Alien OG flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers an average yield. Once they\u2019ve harvested, growers should also take care to properly cure their flowers to preserve this strain\u2019s high composition of THC. Curing is a two-stage process that involves first hanging flowers upside down for 7-10 days in a room with 50% humidity and a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit; and then, once stems snap easily off the flowers, sealing the buds in clean, airtight jars in a space that maintains 70 degree temperatures and 60-65% humidity.

A cross between Purple Elephant and Chemdawg Sour Diesel, the strain regularly features THC percentages between\u00a016 and\u00a022 percent and a CBD count up to 1 percent.\u00a0 Grape Stomper is a craft breed, originated by independent growers and appropriated by other breeders. There are many strains out there with \u201cgrape\u201d in the name, but Grape Stomper is one of the originals.\u00a0 True to its name, this strain smells like grape. The fruity aroma is subtle, not strong, which may disappoint some people. The coloring is also not quite as purple as one might expect. The trichomes get in the way of seeing the buds, which are thick with resin and have plentiful orange hairs.\u00a0 To smell the bud better, remove it from the bag or bottle and break up the nugs. If you do, you might also get a faint waft of diesel or chemical smell, indicative of Grape Stomper\u2019s parent. You should be able to pick out the grape smell and maybe detect some floral notes. The smoke is light, not dense, which medical users will appreciate, especially if coughing is painful. Like other hybrids though, after the head rush, a mellow effect settles in the body after a few minutes. People have described the high as bouncy, not the couch-locked reputation of an Indica, although Grape Stomper does have some Indica effects. People can use this strain in the morning or during the day as Grape Stomper helps you remain alert, functional, and social.\u00a0 Even though Grape Stomper works on the head with its cerebral high, novice users may get bogged down in the body melt. Therefore, due to the potency of the strain, intermediate and advanced cannabis users might be most suited to unlock the strain\u2019s multiple personalities.\u00a0 Not noted for its strong medical uses, people can still blunt their mild pain or other medical symptoms with this strain. People with mild anxiety or depression may enjoy this strain as will people with headaches and insomnia. Growers say that the buds on your plants should be chunky, dark green and purple with crystals. Expect the plant to grow to 3 or 4 feet high and have a high yield. Flowering generally occurs around the 72 day mark. In its true form this strain is available as a clone only. Clones can be purchased by it's\u00a0breeder, Gage Green Genetics.\u00a0 A balanced hybrid, Grape Stomper works as mild medicine.

This indica dominant hybrid has a high THC count and low CBD and never fails to delight both the recreational and medical user. Snow White, staying true to its name, is a pretty sight to behold. It grows to a maximum height of 36 inches (3 feet), and has a nice, closely packed and elegant bonsai spruce shape. Its leaves are oval, broad and dark green. The huge and dense buds are pleasantly soft. Even though they are dark green like the leaves, being thoroughly covered in an astounding number of resins makes the buds appear pale. Numerous dark brown and red hairs give the nugs an extra fluffy look, and the resins give the impression that the plant has recently been snowed upon, which makes it truly gorgeous. This strain has an earthy, citrus laden aroma, which can also be found in its taste. The adventurous earthy flavor is complemented by a nutty and flowery sweetness, with a sweet lemon aftertaste. The smoke itself is very smooth and thick, and carry a citrusy flavor. Snow White, like the fairytale itself, is both very fun and helpful. It creates a pleasant and soothing body buzz and provides a mellow head high. It induces relaxing feelings of elation, happiness, hunger and creativity, which makes it perfect for recreational use. The high lasts for about 2 hours, and leaves a friendly, tingling sensation. In addition to aiding in recreational activities, Snow White does wonders in terms of medicinal benefits as well. It helps to sooth effects of chemotherapy, nausea, and anxiety, while simultaneously alleviating depression, stress, pain, lack of appetite, insomnia and fatigue. First bred by Nirvana Seeds, this strain has quickly become a fan favorite. Flowering takes 8-10 weeks, but the early and abundant resin production starts just two weeks into flowering. Growers are recommended to use the Sea of Green hydro system for an exceptional yield \u2013 it commonly yields 450g per square meter in a Sea of Green under a 600W lamp.

Hash Plant was a renowned building block of many Sensi Seeds strains over the years, although it was rare to find outside of the Cannabis Castle breeding program. It was later reintroduced to the market by Sensi Seed Bank in 1999. The Hash Plant nuggets hold an earthy, woody aroma, with a hint of hash and a dash of sweetness for good measure. The smell, though quite distinct, is not overly pungent (or offensive to non-users). The deliciously spicy taste gives way to a quick and powerful body stone. The tight buds are simply covered in resin, that dries into a delicious crispiness. The nuggets feature medium to dark green leaves, with deep red hairs. The effects make users deeply relaxed, and some may even become couch locked or sleepy. This makes it a good choice for treating insomnia. Hash Plant is used to treat Gastrointestinal Disorder, as well as Crohn's Disease. The pain fighting effects prove useful in treating migraines, acting as a clutch migraine deterrent at their onset. Those suffering anxiety may also use it to alleviate symptoms and relax. It can also help those afflicted with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This is more suggested for night time use, or on those lazy, relaxing days with no responsibilities or obligations to fulfill. Hash Plant has a flowering time of 40 to\u00a045 days, and generally grows to 3 to\u00a04 feet in height. The quick finish makes it a great choice for growers looking for a short grow time.

Different phenotypes of this strain have tested at between 15% and 20% THC; as a result, effects are mild to moderate but can become more potent as dosage is increased. There is some ambiguity around this strain\u2019s parentage. It is commonly thought to be a cross between an OG Kush parent and Diablo, a sativa hybrid created by Canadian seed company Next Generation; the Diablo parent strain (which won the long-running British Columbia Harvest Cup in 2002) is itself a cross between flavorful Blueberry, Grapefruit, and South African landrace strains, giving it the complex fruity flavor that is so evident in Diablo OG. Others claim that Diablo OG is simply a distinct phenotype of the OG Kush-descended Ghost OG; however, Diablo OG\u2019s effects are generally more cerebral than the couchlock typically associated with Ghost and other OGs. The creation of Diablo OG is often credited to Los Angeles-based dispensary Reseda Discount Caregivers. Reseda is also known for signature OG strains like Herijuana OG, a potent indica-dominant strain that is beneficial for insomnia relief. Diablo OG\u2019s appealing taste and well-rounded high have made it a building block for crossbreeding -- Southern California\u2019s Riot Seeds has crossed Diablo OG with powerful indica Sand Storm to produce the rare Diablo OG Kush Storm. When properly cured, healthy buds of Diablo OG are large and dark green. Some phenotypes show traces of purple, the result of high amounts of anthocyanin compounds in the leaves that turn purple when exposed to cold air. Brown to dark orange pistils are threaded through the dense Diablo OG buds. The flowers are covered in sticky crystalline trichomes -- this strain\u2019s high resin content makes it a popular choice for the production of concentrates like shatter and butane hash oil. The smell of Diablo OG can be broadly categorized as both flowery and diesel-like; closer consideration yields notes of pine and citrus fruit. Diablo OG also retains the trademark OG hashy, munky undertones. The smoke is said to be smooth but lung expanding, and to taste sweet with hints of spice and pepper when exhaled. This is a very pungent strain and should be treated as such by both consumers and growers if discretion is a concern. It may take some time before the effects of Diablo OG are fully appreciated: users report waiting up to 15 minutes to feel its well-balanced high. The predominant characteristics are a clearheaded sense of focus -- albeit without the intensity that can provoke paranoia and anxiety in some users -- and a thorough sense of physical relaxation, soothing chronic pain and sore muscles. Many users report some relief from acute anxiety and a renewed sense of perspective and clarity. This mental acuity has been compared to the soaring sativa effects that result from South African landrace strains -- lending further credence to the idea that Diablo OG is descended from the original Diablo strain. Unlike many other OG strains, Diablo OG is not particularly known for inducing incapacitating couchlock, and it can be enjoyed in tandem with activities that require some focus or mobility. One common complaint is pervasive drymouth, particularly when this strain is smoked in large quantities in rapid succession. Because of its even-handed effects, Diablo OG is appropriate at any time of day -- whether as a uplifting, motivating aid or a soothing bedtime medicine. Fortunately, this strain\u2019s high is said to last longer than average. This is a clone-only strain, meaning that prospective growers need to obtain viable clippings from a mature plant in order to cultivate Diablo OG. An outdoor growing environment should have a consistent temperature between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite the strain\u2019s sativa dominance, Diablo OG plants are more indica in appearance; indoor growers will need enough space to accommodate bushy plants with strong horizontal branching. Plants that are successfully grown from clones should reach anywhere from 5 to 6 feet in height. Growers will want to practice topping, or trimming of the fan leaves towards the top of the plant\u2019s central stalk to ensure that flowers on lower branches receive the maximum amount of light. Diablo OG plants typically flower between 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and are ready for harvest in late September when grown outdoors. The yield is moderate, although buds themselves are typically larger than average. Since this strain is also particularly pungent, growers cultivating indoors should make use of odor-control technology like carbon filters. Diablo OG is popular in California but is relatively difficult to find outside the West Coast. Its moderate THC content makes it a suitable strain for novice smokers, although it\u2019s potent enough to keep cannabis enthusiasts afloat. Although its purple varieties have some \u201cbag appeal\u201d, Diablo OG\u2019s real standout characteristic is its floral yet skunky smell and taste.

The couch-lock effect of this strain can be nearly overwhelming and cause some users to feel sleepy. It is a feel-good high that leaves one feeling happy even after the high fades. Some users report an increase in libido while using this strain. The downsides to A-Train are all fairly common - dry eyes and mouth with occasional bouts of paranoia and anxiety for some users. Because one of the strain's first most pronounced effects is the munchies, A-Train is often used by people suffering from anorexia and nausea. Others use it for insomnia, opting to let the sleepy buzz overtake them for a restful night. People dealing with chronic minor aches and pains can benefit from the strain, but those with severe pain will likely pass on it. Due to the happy high, it is also used to help regulate anxiety and mood disorders such as depression. The strain is most often used for evening and night-time medicating.

It is a distinct phenotype of Bubble Gum, a multiple Cannabis Cup award winner whose mysterious genetics were established in Indiana and then tweaked over several botanical generations in the The Netherlands. Bubblicious was created by Nirvana Seeds, the prolific breeding group responsible for potent strains like Black Jack and Jock Horror. \u00a0Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found Bubblicious flowers to have anywhere from 15% to as much as 25% THC. Bubblicious boasts large flowers that taper off into a clear conical shape. The cured flowers adhere in a somewhat fluffy bud structure, with wispy leaves clinging to the central stems. The leaves themselves are spring green with yellow pistils. In some phenotypes, shades of purple and even pink stand out in the flowers; these vibrant colors come about when high genetic concentrations of anthocyanin pigments are agitated by cold weather in the growing process. When cured properly, buds of Bubblicious has an intensely sweet and strawberry-like scent that indeed smells like saccharine bubble gum; it may also remind some users of cotton candy. When broken up, buds also emit some dank, earthy odors. Bubblicious has a smooth smoke that leaves a fruity, skunky taste lingering on the smoker\u2019s palate. This unique strain is particularly pungent -- \u00a0those looking to keep their consumption discreet may want to plan ahead. Bubblicious moves quickly for an indica, conferring a heaviness in the head and limbs. A wave of relaxation may make users move or speak more slowly. Despite this slowdown in physical functioning, however, smokers do not lose mental clarity -- Bubblicious stimulates rapid associations in thinking and can be a great tool for creative work or for solving entrenched problems that may require a new perspective. Bubblicious\u2019 action on both mind and body make it appropriate for many different activities, including exercise, errands, and socializing. Its can be enjoyed at any time of day and is said to be potent even for cannabis veterans. This strain has value for medical cannabis patients as well. The newfound thoughtfulness that comes with Bubblicious can help those with moderate anxiety or depression to appreciate their surroundings and to live more \u201cin the moment.\u201d A sustained sense of focus can also be useful for those with attention deficit disorders. Its sedative effects can be a salve for deep-seated pain, whether superficial or chronic and nerve-related while anti-emetic and anti-convulsive properties make this a treatment for nausea. Because it can stimulate recursive thinking at the same time that it promotes relaxation, Bubblicious is not necessarily recommended for use before bedtime to relieve insomnia. Breeders Nirvana Seeds have made packaged seeds of Bubblicious available for retail. At-home growers can also obtain cuttings from mature plants to serve as \u201cclones.\u201d A hearty plant, Bubblicious is a good choice for novice growers and can be successfully cultivated indoors or out (although outdoor growing requires warm, semi-humid climates). The plants have a characteristically indica shape, short and bushy with strong lateral branching. Growers should \u201ctop off\u201d these plants by trimming away any large leaves that could block light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Growers should also bring out the flowers\u2019 full colorful potential by occasionally exposing plants to colder than averages temperatures late in the vegetative stage. This strain flowers within a brief 6 to 9 weeks when grown indoors. As much as Bubblicious is a pungent smoke, it is also a pungent grow, and anyone looking to keep their operations secret should invest in odor control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans. Curing the buds -- by first hanging them up to dry and then sealing them in airtight containers with moderate humidity -- will help preserve their singular flavor and resin production. Bubblicious is popular in Amsterdam where it was initially perfected. It only stands to gain a higher profile in the U.S. market, where evenly-balanced and flavorful hybrids are in constant demand.

Breaking open the buds gives off a somewhat unpleasant musk that some experienced smokers might find similar to Cheese strains. When burnt, Moonwalker Kush creates a harsh, acrid smoke that may sting the sinuses and induce coughing. On the exhale, users may detect a spicy lingering aftertaste. A bit of a creeper, Moonwalker Kush has effects that mount slowly, eventually hitting users with a tingle that begins in the head and moves throughout the body. There is an initial sense of disorientation -- senses may feel sharper and users can perceive sights and sounds more intensely than before. Once settled in, however, smokers can enjoy a rambling free association of thoughts. Such cerebral stimulation easily lends itself to creative work or to friendly conversation. Moonwalker Kush comes with some physical effects as well: as the high progresses or as higher dosages are consumed, users will feel this strain\u2019s OG Kush influence in a wave of relaxation. Heavy, numb limbs may provoke the feeling of melting into one\u2019s surroundings, eventually leading to intractable couchlock. These far-reaching recreational effects have medical uses as well. Moonwalker Kush can be an effective analgesic for anything from sore muscles to nerve-related pain conditions. It can relieve headaches and migraines and may even have the ability to suppress seizures and spasms. Its unique elevation of both body and mind can mitigate the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress, helping patients to appreciate their surroundings and to live \u201cin the moment.\u201d This strain\u2019s sustained sense of focus can also be beneficial to those with attention deficit disorders. In large amounts, Moonwalker Kush brings on sleep, crushing stubborn cases of insomnia. Finally, because its cerebral effects are grounded by a potent body stone, this variety comes with a lessened risk of episodic paranoia. A recent crossbreed, Moonwalker Kush may be difficult to find outside of the Pacific Northwest. Packaged seeds have not yet been released for sale and clones may be similarly hard to come by. As a result, we have limited information on cultivating this strain. As with any cannabis strain, though, it can be successfully cultivated in controlled indoor conditions or in outdoor operations with semi-humid climates in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Although it\u2019s a balanced strain, Moonwalker Kush\u2019s indica leanings make it more suited to nighttime than to morning or afternoon use. Its coveted equilibrium between thoughtfulness and physical stimulation make it a great choice for activities that involve both the body and brain -- including, but not limited to, eating, exercise, and sex. In the right set and setting, Moonwalker Kush may even inspire smokers to teach themselves how to moonwalk."], "attributes": {"anxiety": 20, "pain": 60, "insomnia": 80, "relaxed": 100, "sleepy": 40, "euphoric": 80, "paranoia": 40, "appetite": 100, "dry eyes": 20, "nausea": 80}}], "thai lights": [{"source": "QANNABIS", "kind": [50, 50, 0], "description": "Thai genetics from Nakan Pranom in Thailand marries Northern Lights indica.

Its distinctive name has more to do with its genetic lineage -- a cross between the popular Blueberry and the UK-native strain Cheese -- than its taste, which is surprisingly fruity. Name has more to do w lineage than taste. Blue Cheese achieves its potency with an average THC composition of about 15% to 20%. Breeder Big Buddha Seeds, who perfected a phenotype of parent strain Cheese, is credited with introducing one variety of Blue Cheese to the cannabis market. The Netherlands-based operations Barney\u2019s Farm and Royal Queen Seeds also produce and sell seeds for a distinct Blue Cheese variety. Cured buds of Blue Cheese are large and have a very dense bud structure. The tightly-packed leaves are light to medium green and are threaded through with copper-colored hairs (which are actually pollen-collecting pistils). This is a very resinous strain, and flowers are correspondingly covered in sticky white trichomes. When fresh, Blue Cheese buds are difficult to break up by hand and typically require use of a grinder. This strain has \u201cbag appeal\u201d in the form of its pungent aroma -- flowers primarily have a fruity, berry smell, inherited from parent strain Blueberry. Rounding out this sweetness is a tangy hint of cheese, which some have compared to musk or even rotten vegetables. When flowers are combusted, the smoke is thick and lung-expanding, and can induce some serious coughing for users who take a big enough hit. Once smokers get past this eye-watering, palate-tickling pungency, they\u2019ll notice an entirely fruity blueberry taste on the exhale, absent of cheesy funk. However, this strain can leave a musty, hash-like aftertaste that lingers in the mouth long after smoke has been exhaled. The high from this strain can creep up slowly -- without the initial headrush that\u2019s associated with many cerebral sativa strains, this indica will gradually bring on a sense of physical relaxation and an altered way of thinking that may catch smokers by surprise. This mellow indica vibe is excellent for restfulness and de-stressing, but it won\u2019t necessarily lead to incapacitating couchlock -- although couchlock is a possibility with larger and larger doses. Blue Cheese\u2019s physical effects make it a good means of relief from minor aches and pains, as well as an aid to counteract insomnia. On the sativa side, Blue Cheese confers a mildly euphoric high that won\u2019t leave users trapped in a cerebral loop of recursive thinking. As such, it\u2019s a great option for treating anxiety, depression, and even some symptoms associated with PTSD. Its clearheaded and focused high is also beneficial for those with attention deficit disorders. Blue Cheese can also be a strong appetite stimulant, for better or worse. Less desirable effects may include dizziness and some paranoia if Blue Cheese is consumed in large enough doses. This strain is optimal for enjoyment from early evening to nighttime, as a way to unwind after the workday or as an after-dinner treat. Blue Cheese is a relatively easy strain to grow. Seeds are available from the aforementioned breeders; prospective growers can also obtain healthy clippings from mature plants to grow \u201cclones.\u201d The strain can be grown outdoors, but like most varieties of cannabis, requires a consistent source of sunlight and a constant temperature of between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Indoor cultivation may be a more appealing option, as plants have a characteristically bushy indica shape, with strong horizontal branches. Blue Cheese has a high leaf-to-bud ratio, meaning that growers should trim the broad fan leaves that grow at the top of the plant in order to allow light to reach flowering nodes on the lower branches. This strain flowers within 8 to 10 weeks indoors and is ready for harvest by late September when grown outdoors. It is a heavy yielder, with large flowers clustered around the terminal cola as well as the lateral branches; growers can expect about 500 to 600 grams (or about 1 to 1.3 pounds) per square meter of plant. As noted, Blue Cheese is also famously pungent, so if discretion is a primary concern, growers should isolate outdoor plants and invest in odor control measures for indoor plants like carbon filters. More common on the West Coast than other areas of the U.S., Blue Cheese is a pleasantly balanced strain that achieves equally potent effects on the body and mind. It\u2019s well-suited to mindless post-work or weekend unwinding, as well as to tasks or errands that have to be performed during the day. The sense of uplift makes it a popular option for social gatherings as well. With such qualities to recommend it, Blue Cheese is unlikely to be as polarizing as its dairy counterpart. Don\u2019t be fooled, though -- this is one strain of cannabis whose smell is unlikely to fly under the radar."], "attributes": {"anxiety": 60, "pain": 100, "relaxed": 60, "insomnia": 60, "euphoric": 100, "creative": 40, "appetite": 80, "cotton mouth": 20, "depression": 40, "dry eyes": 20}}], "royal flush": [{"source": "FOURTWENTY101", "kind": [50, 50, 1], "description": "Gage Green Group seed\\'s, \"Royal Flush\" is a dark colored and insanely frosty hybrid variety that churns out heavy amounts of gorgeous ganja in a very short amount of time.

The high from Jesus OG takes hold quickly: users may detect a head buzz or may feel their eyes inadvertently narrowing. Such effects are soon met with a newfound sense of cerebral focus. Objects or random thoughts can take on a whole new significance. Because it is so thought-provoking, this strain is great as an aid for work that calls for analysis or creativity. There may be some slightly psychedelic effects as well -- as their senses become more attuned to their surroundings, smokers may perceive sounds, colors, or even tastes more intensely. Jesus OG comes with physical sensations as well. At the very least, relief of tension in the muscles and chest can be expected. In higher doses, this strain can even pin users down on the nearest couch. These well-rounded effects also have application for medical cannabis patients. Jesus OG sedative properties can provide relief from chronic, troubling aches and pains. It can relieve moderate headaches and more serious migraines. The same relaxation that this strain bestows on users\u2019 eyes can even be an effective treatment for the painful intraocular pressure that comes with glaucoma. Meanwhile, Jesus OG\u2019s euphoric uplift can be a great temporary treatment for those struggling with stress, anxiety, depression and PTSD. Its clearheaded focus can assist patients with attention deficit disorders. However, because of this strain\u2019s tendency to bring about freely-associative thinking, it may provoke panic or paranoia for those not accustomed to the \u201cmindrace\u201d that comes with potent sativas. Fortunately, TGA Subcool has made seeds of Jesus OG available for commercial sale. Prospective growers can also obtain trimmings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow \u201cclones.\u201d Jesus OG can be successfully cultivated indoors or out. The typically tall plants may do well in open-air environments where they can stretch and maximize yield. However, outdoor growing calls for warm, Mediterranean-like climates with daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Indoors, plants will respond well to carefully monitored conditions; their height can be managed to fit in restricted spaces if growers take the time to train the plants, bending and pruning branches early in the vegetative stage. Jesus OG flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers a larger than average yield. As enjoyable during the day as it is at night, Jesus OG is great for introspection and for tackling thorny problems that might require a new perspective. Although it works well in many different situations, this is a very social strain that works great at parties, lifting spirits and stimulating conversation. It may not provide you with a profound spiritual experience, but Jesus OG is sure to take you on a pleasant psychedelic jaunt."], "attributes": {"anxiety": 80, "pain": 40, "add adhd": 100, "relaxed": 40, "creative": 80, "focused": 100, "appetite": 40, "cotton mouth": 20, "depression": 100, "dry eyes": 20}}], "vgh og": [{"source": "FOURTWENTY101", "kind": [100, 0, 1], "description": "SoCal Seed Co.\\'s very own, \"VGH OG\" is an Indica dominant hybrid that bears the genetic lineage of two amazing California bred cannabis varieties, the Tahoe OG and the Chem D.

The other is an indica-leaning hybrid bred by Anesia Seeds from Spain. Sumo Seeds\u2019 indica Cali Kush is a cross between award-winning Mendocino Purps and staple indica LA Confidential. It has small to medium-sized buds that appear mostly spherical with a tight and dense bud structure. The pale green leaves are streaked with shades of blue and purple which come about when high concentrations of pigments in the plant (likely passed on from the Purps parent strain) are stimulated by cold temperatures during cultivation. Cured flowers of this Cali Kush have a mostly floral, herbal scents with some hints of mint. Smoke is smooth and has a fruity aftertaste. This strain has a well-rounded high despite its entirely indica genetics. Users may have initial feelings of thoughtfulness and sharpened perception. Instead of disorienting cerebral mindrace, though, smokers will experience a progressive physical relaxation to ground their thoughtfulness and bring them back down to earth. Cali Kush can serve as an accompaniment to socializing in familiar surroundings or unwinding alone. It has medical application as a means of temporary stress and anxiety relief. Its lucidity and focus can help those with attention deficit disorder to focus on a single task. It can also soothe aching joints and muscles and, in high enough doses, lull those with insomnia to sleep. Sumo Seeds\u2019 creation is suited to use at any time of day. Although Sumo appears to have made seeds of Cali Kush available at some point, the strain has since been discontinued for commercial sale. Prospective growers must obtains clippings from mature, healthy plants to grow genetically identical \u201cclones.\u201d Once rooted, clones can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Anyone looking to bring out this strain\u2019s visual appeal should expose plants to cold temperatures at night just before flowering in order to stimulate their pigments. Conveniently, plants flower within a quick 6 to 7 weeks. They offer growers a medium yield of flowers. Anesia Seeds\u2019 Cali Kush is a cross between tasty Strawberry Kush and a phenotype of none other than OG Kush. It has medium to large-sized buds that are spade-shaped and, although they have a tight bud structure, have somewhat wispy, fluffy leaves. The leaves themselves are a yellowish-green, set off by pistils that range in color from brown to vibrant orange. This strain\u2019s aroma is predominantly of citrus, with a sweet and somewhat dank base. When it is broken up or ground, some more peppery, Kush-like notes might be evident. This Cali Kush burns with a smooth smoke and when exhaled leaves behind a skunky and overall tropical impression. Anesia\u2019s Cali Kush has a high that comes on fans for an indica. Smokers may feel a sudden heaviness in the head that spreads through the limbs and core. The quick sedative effects may bring about a desire to lounge in the closest comfortable surroundings. More calming than thought-provoking, this strain\u2019s head high manifests as a pleasantly hazy, dreamy state. For medical cannabis patients, this Cali Kush can have a range of applications. Its mellow vibe can place a damper on the troubling symptoms of stress, anxiety, and PTSD. It can also relieve aches and pains, whether they\u2019re incidental, due to injury or exercise, or chronic, due to conditions like arthritis. More of an evening or nighttime treat than a wake-and-bake strain, this bud\u2019s effects may ultimately lead to deep and restful sleep. Luckily, Anesia has made seeds of their Cali Kush available for purchase online. With strong and varied genetics, this may be a good options for newcomers to cannabis cultivation. It can be grown outdoors, but successful outdoor cultivation depends on a warm, Mediterranean-like climate. The short, indica-typical plants, which rarely exceed 3 feet in height, are very manageable in indoor grow spaces. Growers should be sure to \u201ctop off\u201d their plants, trimming away any broad, light-blocking fan leaves to encourage flowering among lower branches.

This classic strain was created by master breeder Skunk VA at The Cali Connection in June 2011. Since its birth, it has become highly popular in the western region of the U.S. The aroma of Deadhead is very pungent, yet pleasant. Patients often describe notes of pine, lemon, and wood in both the raw buds and the smoke. Its earthy fragrance is very smooth, but can easily permeate a house. A wide range of ailments can be successfully treated by Deadhead OG, including anxiety, insomnia, chronic depression, stress, and pain. Once smoked, mood elevation sets in almost immediately. Feelings of amusement and euphoria are common, and this mood improvement generally lasts for several hours. The mental high is very stimulating, resulting in increased focus and introspection, rather than a dazed, stoned feeling.

This agreeable, well-balanced strain has inherited the dynamic fruity taste that has made its Blue Dream parent one of the most popular strains circulating today. With Haze, Diesel, and landrace roots, Alpha Blue is as potent as it is tasty -- in 2011, it won the title of 2nd Best Sativa in two different regional High Times Cannabis Cups. Also known as Dream Diesel, this strain carries 15% to 20% THC. Alpha Blue commands respect with medium to large flowers that taper into triangular, spade-like shapes. The flowers also have the distinction of looking more like flowers than dense, compressed buds. A sativa-typical structure means that the leaves grow off of central stems in tufts and have a fluffy texture and appearance. The leaves themselves are a vibrant spring green and are threaded through with red and orange hairs; these hairs are actually pistils, the female plant\u2019s reproductive structures that collect pollen from male plants. Notably, Alpha Blue does not seem to have inherited the pigmentation from grandparent strain Blueberry that results in blue and purple hues. This strain\u2019s scent, however, is undoubtedly familiar to fans of Alpha Blue and Blue Dream. The smell of sweet blueberries wafts off of the cured flowers. A slightly sour funk from NYC Diesel also imparts a more tart character to the berry smell. When ground or broken up, Alpha Blue\u2019s flowers show their Diesel influence even more, with a sweet, fuel-tinged odor. This strain has a smooth smoke when burnt and tastes peppery on the exhale with a lingering aftertaste of sour fruit. This is a strain that does not take long to make itself known. After smoking Alpha Blue, users may feel a slight constriction of facial muscles manifesting as a pressure around the eyes and temples. These disorienting physical effects are met with an enhancement of the senses -- smokers might perceive sights, sounds, and even textures more intensely. A spike in cerebral activity is also common, with recursive or freely associative thoughts. Fortunately, any anxiety-inducing sense of \u201cmindrace\u201d is mellowed out by a slight body buzz that makes all tension evaporate. That said, this strain will not leave you couchlocked or make you feel out of control of your body. \u00a0Alpha Blue\u2019s combination of relaxation, uplifted mood, and mental stimulation makes it suited to a wide variety of settings, both solo and social. Medically speaking, Alpha Blue has both physiological and psychological applications. Its euphoric effects are great for those struggling with symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Its lucid sense of focus is also great for patients with attention deficit disorders. Alpha Blue\u2019s subtle body melt, relaxing without being incapacitating, can even relieve deep-seated, chronic aches and pains. This strain\u2019s high is said to be particularly long-lasting, even for users with a high THC tolerance. Because it\u2019s an emerging strain -- and because its provenance and creation is not well-documented -- there is only limited information available on the cultivation of Alpha Blue. With no packaged seeds available for commercial sale, prospective growers must rely on clippings from mature, existing plants in order to grow genetically identical \u201cclones.\u201d Because it\u2019s a hybrid, it may be successfully cultivated, although outdoor growing requires warm, Mediterranean-like climates with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After obtaining clones and taking the trouble to grown Alpha Blue, growers should also properly cure their flowers to preserve taste and potency. Curing involves first hanging buds upside down by the stem or lay them on drying racks that provide air circulation for 7 to 10 days; the surrounding humidity should be 50% and the temperature about 70 degrees Fahrenheit.

No longer just a novelty cocktail, White Russian is a potent hybrid strain that leans on some famous genetics. Originally produced by Dutch seed bank Serious Seeds, White Russian is a cross between sativa-dominant AK-47 and the notoriously potent sativa White Widow. These building blocks give White Russian a powerful and introspective head high. This strain won 1st place in the best overall category at the 1996 High Time Cannabis Cup, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. With consistently high THC composition between 20 and 25%, White Russian is sure to make an impact on any who try it. Buds of White Russian tend to be small to medium in size. Their bud structure is more typical of sativa strains, with loosely-clustered, fluffy leaves. The leaves are pale green and, depending on the individual plant phenotype, may be moderately to thoroughly covered in frosty trichomes like parent strain White Widow. Cured properly, the flowers have an earthy, dank smell (imparted from White Widow, which is known more for its extreme stickiness than its taste profile) mixed with some sweet citrus fruit (passed on from AK-47, which has a sweet and floral aftertaste from the various Asian and South American landrace strains in its genetics). When combusted, flowers smell more skunky and slightly spicy. Some have described the smoke from White Russian as harsh and lung-expanding. Smoke tastes slightly spicy when exhaled. The high from this strain takes hold almost immediately in the form of some initial disorientation and tightening around the temples. Users report feeling quickly energized and motivated, and being able to function with more clarity than confusion. As is characteristic of parent strain White Widow, White Russian has an intensely cerebral high that can lend itself to introspection, lateral thinking for problem solving, and creative inspiration. A sense of euphoria and emotional well-being can accompany this mental stimulation. Despite some indica in its genetics, this strain carries very little physical effects -- although, as with any variety of cannabis, heavy consumption can lead to couchlock and drowsiness. White Russian\u2019s powerful head high makes it effective in treating anxiety and depression. It is also particularly beneficial for users with attention deficit disorders. Red, dry eyes are a common side effect, a result of the high THC in this strain dilating blood vessels and capillaries controlling blood flow to the eyes. Because of its cerebral intensity, White Russian also has the potential to veer into paranoid or anxious territory; users should consider their individual tolerance as well as their mindset and setting before enjoying this strain. More likely to leave you wired than lazy, White Russian is definitely a strain to be enjoyed during the daytime. Plants of White Russian may be user-friendly for even novices to grow; the strain\u2019s hearty genetics mean that it is more resistant to adverse growing conditions and not as high-maintenance as many other strains. That said, growing this variety outdoors requires a consistently warm temperature and a direct albeit not overpowering source of sunlight. Plants are relatively short and bushy for a sativa-dominant variety, reaching between 3 and 4 feet tall when grown indoors. Plants also have a low leaf-to-flower ratio, meaning that cultivators won\u2019t need to worry as much about trimming fan leaves during the vegetative state. Grown indoors, plants flower after 8 to 9 weeks. Outdoors, plants are ready for harvest in mid to late October. This is a very pungent variety, even before plants begin to flower. As such, indoor growers may want to counteract the strain\u2019s skunkiness with odor control measures like carbon filters or exhaust fans. This bold cerebral strain provides some of the best of what sativa varieties have to offer. White Russian stimulates the mind while leaving the body relatively functional. This makes it ideal for complicated tasks involving problem solving or creative thinking -- for example, it would be an excellent choice to consume before playing cards with friends. Because of its tendency towards introspection, White Russian might be more easily enjoyed in privacy, or at least in familiar company and a comfortable setting. It\u2019s more of a daytime smoke, but its energizing properties can also be used to ward off sleep, if necessary. Because of their high resin content, White Russian flowers are ideal for the production of hash, shatter, and other THC concentrates. Notably, White Russian\u2019s creators Serious Seeds are committed to preserving the provenance and integrity of the strain: they assign a unique serial number to every bag of seeds they sell, allowing the cannabis to be tracked from initial production to point-of-sale in dispensaries. This accountability not only edges out impostors and inferior products, it also allows for the production transparency that is so necessary in today\u2019s increasingly regulated legal cannabis market. \u00a0"], "attributes": {"anxiety": 40, "pain": 80, "relaxed": 60, "headace": 20, "euphoric": 100, "creative": 40, "appetite": 20, "dry eyes": 20, "depression": 40, "nausea": 100}}], "freeze cheese '89": [{"source": "FOURTWENTY101", "kind": [100, 0, 1], "description": "The \"Freeze Cheese \\'89\" is a hard hitting Indica dominant hybrid that was bred, stabilized and released by the award winning breeders at the Big Buddha Seed company in Amsterdam.

This variety is a cross between two celebrated California strains: the fruity Mendocino Purple from NorCal and L.A.\u2019s own hashy San Fernando Valley (SFV) OG Kush. With very sticky flowers and a pleasant, floaty high, it\u2019s no wonder this strain won 3rd Best Indica in the 2014 Cannabis Cup. Blackwater\u2019s THC, as measured by cannabis lab Analytics 360, can range from 10% to a potent 20%. Blackwater\u2019s chunky buds have a classically indica bud structure: leaves are densely-packed and tightly curled in on themselves when properly cured. High resin production makes the leaves adhere in large, solid flowers rather than popcorn-like nuggets. The flowers appear dark green, with some phenotypes showing flashes of purple inherited from the Mendocino Purple parent strain; this latter color comes about when high concentrations of specific pigments are activated by colder than average weather in the cultivation process. Blackwater\u2019s large, colorful buds are covered in a substantial layer of trichomes, often making them difficult to break apart by hand. This strain\u2019s \u201cbag appeal\u201d persists even after the bag is cracked open -- users will notice a deeply sweet smell of berry and grape to complement its purple hues. Taking time to break open the flowers will also show evidence of the Afghani landrace lineage, with an unmistakably herbal, hashy smell. When burnt, Blackwater gives off an incense-like smoke that is surprisingly smooth for an indica. The satisfying hit finishes with a fruity and vaguely skunky cloud that may linger for a while. Definitely a strain made for staying in and not venturing out, Blackwater offers a palpable indica body stone. Although it mounts slowly, smokers shouldn\u2019t underestimate this high\u2019s ability to comfortably pin them down in their surroundings. Within minutes, a sense of calm envelops the core and spreads down through the limbs, allowing users to breathe comfortably and easily. Although there may be some psychedelic changes in perception like visual distortion, cerebral thinking isn\u2019t common; users should expect a more dreamy high, perfect for unwinding with a movie or some favorite music without bothering to follow along or reflect too intensely. This full body high intensifies as greater amounts are consumed. Medically speaking, these narcotic effects have diverse applications. Blackwater\u2019s physical numbing makes it an effective painkiller for those with aches and pains, whether incidental from exercise or injury, or more chronic caused by conditions like fibromyalgia. It can even relieve some of the negative side effects of chemotherapy treatment. Blackwater is also helpful for stress-related conditions like anxiety and PTSD, temporarily melting away preoccupations and concerns. In large enough doses, this strain can induce deep sleep for those who suffer from insomnia. With a high that lasts longer than average, Blackwater is known to be one potent indica, even for those with a high tolerance for THC. Although it may be more difficult to track down, Blackwater can be grown as a clone, from clippings of other plants, or from packaged retail seed. Cultivation can happen in or outdoors. Outdoor growing requires a consistently warm and semi-humid climate, with daytime temperatures around 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Growers have more control over conditions indoors, and the short, bushy plants -- which are as classically indica as this strain\u2019s buds -- take well to limited grow spaces. Growers are encouraged to \u201ctop\u201d plants throughout the vegetative process, by trimming any broad, light-blocking fan leaves to allow light and air to reach the lower flowering branches. Blackwater flowers within 8 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and offers an average yield. Because of this strain\u2019s prized taste and THC content, growers should also take care to properly cure their buds, first hanging them for a week in warm surroundings with 50% humidity and then jarring them (and regularly checking them for mold) in similarly warm conditions with 60-65% humidity. Increasingly popular in recreational west coast markets, Blackwater is a great strain for kicking back in the evening -- or at least during a slow day without obligations. Its heavy body stone and great flavor are a treat whether you\u2019re alone at the end of a workday or kicking back with some good friends. Blackwater\u2019s high resin production can also be valuable when producing hash or other concentrates; its unique flavor can carry over into these concentrates as well.

Created by the Vancouver-based Crop King Seeds, it is a cross between landrace-derived AK-47, fruity Mango, and the notoriously resinous White Widow. With a balanced high that can lean in whichever direction the user prefers, Candy Cane scores points for its potent and long-lasting effects. This strain carries between 15% and 20% THC. Candy Cane boasts large flowers that range in shape from spherical clusters to tapered spades. The flowers have somewhat fluffy, wispy leaves that can be tugged off of their central stems. The leaves themselves are forest green and are threaded through with a preponderance of orange hairs (which are actually pistils, intended to catch pollen from male plants). Certain phenotypes of this strain are also distinguished by shades of purple; these vibrant colors are caused by a high genetic concentration of anthocyanins -- pigments like chlorophyll that turn plants different hues of blue and purple when stimulated by cold temperatures. Parent strain White Widow appears to have passed on its predisposition for resin production, as Candy Cane\u2019s colorful flowers are covered in sticky white trichomes. Candy Cane\u2019s aroma is where its appeal really becomes evident. The cured flowers have a sweet and herbal scent, strikingly similar to the peppermint smell of candy canes. When buds are ground up or combusted, they yield a more spicy scent, similar to the earthy incense bouquet of grandparent strain Afghani. Notably, Candy Cane is lacking in any grape-like smell or taste -- this is because the same pigments that turn its leaves purple do not have a corresponding effect on its taste. Candy Cane takes hold quickly, manifesting first as a change in pulse around the eyes and temples. Users may have an initial feeling of \u201cmindrace,\u201d with thoughts jumping from one to the next. This feeling may make sensory perception feel sharper or more intense. As the high progresses, this cerebral activity slows down into a mellow elevation in mood and thinking. These mental effects are accompanied by a pervasive sense of physical relaxation that melts away any lingering stress. The union of mental and physical properties makes this a great strain for socializing in familiar surroundings or simply staying in with a book or some music. This strain\u2019s versatility also makes it useful for medical cannabis patients. Candy Cane\u2019s upbeat nature can be a great temporary treatment for symptoms of stress and depression. Because it allows users to maintain focus, it can also be helpful for those with attention deficit disorders. Calming physical effects may soothe aches and pains -- both nerve-based pain and stomach problems like nausea. The same relaxation of pressure that users may feel around the eyes also makes this strain an effective treatment for glaucoma. Many report Candy Cane to be a powerful appetite stimulant. Because it has some considerable cerebral effects, Candy Cane may lead to recursive thinking and paranoia in larger doses -- as such, those prone to anxiety should consume this strain with caution. Seeds of Candy Cane are available for purchase online from producer Crop King. The strain\u2019s sturdy landrace genetics -- it has roots in Colombia, Mexico, Thailand, and Afghanistan, among others -- make it a good choice for novice growers. It van be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation requires consistently warm and humid climates. Indoor growing may be more convenient, as plants rarely exceed 3 feet in height. The bushy plants also have a high leaf-to-bud ratio, meaning that growers should regularly trim any broad leaves that might be blocking light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Those looking to bring out Candy Cane\u2019s purple hues should also artificially \u201cshock\u201d the plants by exposing them to colder than average temperatures at night. This strain flowers within a short 7 weeks when grown indoors and offers a moderate yield. Plants are known to have a skunky pungency throughout their lifespan; any growers trying to keep their efforts discreet should look into odor control measures, like exhaust fans for their grow space. Candy Cane is appropriate for consumption in the daytime or early evening -- because it can stimulate thoughtfulness, it might not be the best choice right before bedtime.

Its unmistakable strawberry flavor is the result of crossbreeding by cannabis pioneer Kyle Kushman. Its impressive buds won the title of Best Flower in the 2013 Cannabis Cup. Fruity and light, this strain is an uplifting and productive smoke that can be enjoyed in a variety of settings. As its name implies, Strawberry Haze is a cross between Strawberry Fields and old-school staple Haze. The average THC composition of this strain is between 15% and 20%. Kyle Kushman, a former High Times editor and now the proprietor of L.A. dispensary Bud and Roses, developed Strawberry Cough largely by chance in 2000. Kushman claims to have received a small a clone from a fellow breeder -- a runt, the clone had allegedly been grown next to a strawberry patch somewhere in Connecticut. Kushman was struck by the clone\u2019s pungent strawberry scent -- he dubbed the strain Strawberry Field, and eventually crossed it with a Haze plant. The result was Strawberry Cough, a hybrid that tastes soft and sweet and delivers a solidly cerebral high. Kushman built a buzz around Strawberry Cough\u2019s in New York City\u2019s underground cannabis market. He then moved out west to focus on cultivation in California and handed out clones of Strawberry Cough on the cross-country drive, boosting its popularity even more. The strain\u2019s award-winning flowers are large and chunky. Despite its dominant sativa genetics, Strawberry Cough has a more indica-typical bud structure, with solid and densely-packed leaves. The sativa genes show, however, in the buds\u2019 tapered, conical shape, less like popcorn and more like tiny pinecones. The flowers are covered in cloudy amber trichomes that lend the leaves a slightly yellowish appearance. Red -- rather than orange -- pistils are threaded through the sticky leaves. The mild scent of strawberries wafts up from the buds, mixed with a little bit of peppery spice. When buds are combusted, they give off a herbal cloud, reminiscent of parent strain Haze. Smoke from this strain is typically harsh, causing many users to cough and sometimes leading their eyes to water. The initial taste is of ripe strawberries, without any hint of skunkiness or musk. On the exhale, the strawberry flavor has some more sweetness. This saccharine berry scent lingers for a while after users have toked. Strawberry Cough\u2019s buzzy, thoughtful high settles in almost immediately. Users may feel initially unsettled, but, in the right set and setting, can embrace the sharp focus associated with this strain -- it\u2019s great for deep conversation, reading, or working on tasks that involve some degree of creativity or problem-solving. Strawberry Cough can also impart an energetic feeling of motivation and intensity that\u2019s perfect for plowing through more mundane tasks. The opportunity for non-linear and less traditional ways of thinking makes Strawberry Cough a uniquely creative strain. Its sense of euphoria and tendency towards chattiness also marks this as a great choice in lively social settings. Medically speaking, Strawberry Cough is beneficial in regulating entrenched mood disorders. As users feel a boost in energy and creativity, they may feel a dissipation in anxiety or stress. Some have also reported relief from painful migraines, as well as less intense headaches. Side effects of this strain include the possibility of paranoia, which can happen with larger doses when intense cerebral thinking can kick into overdrive. The high from Strawberry Cough is said to last longer than average, from about 3 to 4 hours. Strawberry Cough is a relatively easy strain to grow. Kyle Kushman\u2019s original proprietary strain is clone-only, meaning that growers can only cultivate it if they can obtain a clipping from a mature, healthy plant. However, Amsterdam-based seed bank Dutch Passion has developed its own version of Strawberry Cough -- seeds are available online. Plants tend to be more short and bushy like indicas than tall and wispy like sativas -- of medium height, they are well cultivated indoors. This strain can also be grown outdoors, although plants require very warm climates and continuous temperatures around 70 degrees Fahrenheit. It flowers within 9 weeks when grown indoors and in Late October when grown outdoors. Although the yield from Strawberry Cough is average, the larger-than-average buds are some consolation -- and with sturdy stems and branches, the thick flowers don\u2019t usually require extra stakes for support. The wide popularity of Strawberry Cough shows that taste-focused hybrids are more than just consumer novelty. This strain\u2019s mild but distinctive taste and its expansive high have made it one of the most popular available in dispensaries today -- its appeal has even landed a mention in the apocalyptic movie Children of Men, as Michael Caine and Clive Owen share a joint of the stuff.

Its high leans toward the mellow indica end of the spectrum. Although its name implies some kind of connection to Cherry Pie, Key Lime\u00a0Pie is actually a distinct phenotype of famed strain Girl Scout Cookies -- much like Thin Mints and Animal Cookies. California-based breeder Burnish Bush Nurseries takes responsibility for cultivating this variety. Cannabis testing lab Analytics 360 has consistently found Key Lime Pie flowers to have between 20% and a whopping 25% THC composition. Key Lime Pie produces small to medium-sized buds that adhere in nugget-like shapes. The buds have the tight, dense structure characteristic of indica-dominant varieties. The leaves themselves are a vibrant spring green. Some phenotypes even have purple hues which stand out in contrast. The presence of purple in Key Lime Pie flowers is due to a high genetic concentration of pigments called anthocyanins, which are activated when plants are exposed to cold weather in the vegetative stage. If cured properly, this strain is very sticky and can be difficult to break up for pipes or joints without the use of a grinder. In addition to its striking visuals, Key Lime Pie also boasts a complex flavor profile. Most immediately, the buds have a fruity, slightly sour odor which may remind many of citrus or lime. Underneath these top notes are vaguely herbal scents -- some may detect the same minty freshness associated with Key Lime Pie\u2019s cousin strain Thin Mints. Burning the buds shows off the OG genetics and gives off hints of spice and musk. Notably, this strain is not known for having a grape-like taste; the same anthocyanin pigments that produce its purple leaves are not responsible for any nuances in flavor. Key Lime Pie burns smooth, and on the exhale, leaves the impression of a sweet and sour candy mixed with some spice. This is a fast-acting strain and can strike users before they\u2019ve even finished savoring its strange taste. A deep and heavy relaxation in the face is the most obvious initial effect; this feeling of calm soon spreads throughout the body, relieving tension and allowing users to breathe easily. Although smokers may feel some mental stimulation, the overall feeling is more dreamy than cerebral. A palpable body high pervades, making this a perfect strain to enjoy on a lazy day indoors or at night after a long day of work. In large enough doses, Key Lime Pie can leave users -- especially those with a low THC tolerance -- somewhat spaced-out and couchlocked. Its ability to unleash a wave of relaxation makes Key Lime Pie an ideal painkilling strain for medical cannabis patients. It can dull aches and pains, whether they\u2019re incidental or more chronic and entrenched. It can also be a great way to combat insomnia, lulling users into a deep, refreshing sleep. This strain\u2019s tendency to take the edge off of a frenzied mind also marks it as an effective treatment for some of the symptoms associated with anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Seeds of Key Lime Pie are not commercially available. Instead, this somewhat rare strain must be grown as a clone, from clippings taken from mature and healthy plants. It can be successfully cultivated indoors or outdoors, although outdoor growing requires consistently warm and humid conditions with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Unsurprisingly, Key Lime Pie\u2019s plants have a bushy indica shape, with strong lateral branching. Growers should practice \u201ctopping\u201d in the vegetative stage, which involves trimming light-blocking fan leaves that grow at the top of the plant in order to encourage maximum flowering in the lower branches. To bring out this strain\u2019s eye-catching purple colors, growers may also want to artificially \u201cshock\u201d the plants by exposing them to cold just before flowering occurs. Key Lime Pie flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors. Growers can expect an average yield.

The Sativa effect is felt almost instantly as a heavy wave of cerebral sensations, including feelings of euphoria, uplifted mood, and increased joy and creativity. Common side effects include paranoia, cotton mouth, anxiety, headaches, and dry eyes. Super Bud can be used at different times through the day, depending on the needs of the user.

Colorado growers the Stanley Brothers created this strain specifically for Charlotte Figi -- a young epilepsy patient and medical cannabis user -- by crossing an unspecified strain with industrial hemp. The effectiveness of Charlotte\u2019s Web in treating Figi\u2019s seizures was publicized in a CNN special and garnered enough attention to attract droves of families to Colorado in search of similar relief. \u00a0Charlotte\u2019s Web has spurred a wave of innovation in CBD breeding, giving us strains like Cannatonic. With limited psychoactivity, Charlotte\u2019s Web contains little to no THC. Its CBD content, however, runs from 15 to 20% \u2014 that\u2019s 300 times higher than the CBD of the average recreational strain. Unlike its cousin cannabinoid THC, CBD doesn\u2019t act directly on the body\u2019s endocannabinoid receptors. Instead, it is thought to work indirectly by increasing the availability of the body\u2019s own endocannabinoid compounds to stimulate those receptors. Essentially, CBD may act as a booster to help out many of the body\u2019s naturally functioning processes. Although Charlotte\u2019s Web is available as a concentrated oil for easy medical ingestion, buds of the strain are also available for adults who prefer more traditional consumption. Flowers of this hemp-descended strain have a sativa appearance, with long, tapered buds and olive green leaves. Those accustomed to more psychoactive strains will notice that Charlotte\u2019s Web has relatively few pistils and, due to the near-absence of THC-laden trichomes, very little stickiness. Its scent is more familiar: dank and piney with some light floral notes. When burnt, this strain gives off a smooth smoke. On the exhale, it may taste slightly skunky with an underlying grassy, vegetal taste that speaks to its hemp content. As noted, Charlotte\u2019s Web is bred specifically for a high CBD to THC ratio. That said, depending on the particular phenotype of Charlotte\u2019s Web consumed, users may get some buzzy effects ranging from a heightened sense of well-being to some sensory enhancement. Generally speaking, however, medical-grade Charlotte\u2019s Web comes with negligible psychoactivity, making it a prime choice for patients \u2013 particularly children \u2013 who want to avoid getting high. In fact, researchers believe that the presence of CBD may actually act to shut down any trippy or anxiety-inducing feelings caused by trace amounts of THC. The CBD in this strain can bind to receptors that regulate inflammation, body temperature, and perception of pain, making it a powerful treatment for those suffering from anything from a fever to chronic conditions like fibromyalgia and Parkinson\u2019s Disease. At high levels, CBD can even stimulate serotonin-related receptors, conferring benefits for psychological conditions like anxiety, addiction, and sleep disturbance. Perhaps most significantly, recent studies of CBD have shown that it may work against cancer by destroying existing cancerous cells and halting the spread of new ones. Charlotte\u2019s Web creators the Stanley Brothers have not made the strain\u2019s seeds available for commercial sale; consumers should be wary of any companies purporting to sell seeds under the Charlotte\u2019s Web name. If prospective growers are able to obtain clones of this rare plant, they'll have success growing it both indoors and out -- the hemp in this strain\u2019s genetics centuries for \u00a0is less finicky than cannabis and can thrive in some harsh conditions. Plants have a bushy, indica-like shape. They flower within 8 to 9 weeks and typically offer a high yield of flowers. Growers should also note that only a certain portion of all clones planted will show themselves to be high in CBD -- others may have an equal balance of THC and CBD or simply have a higher concentration of THC. Charlotte\u2019s Web poses a challenging legal bind: advocates who consider it a medical hemp product, genetically distinct from cannabis indica or sativa, clash with legislators who classify it as medical marijuana, banned under federal law. As a result, doctors seeking to test its medical effectiveness in clinical trials are prevented from study because of federal restrictions on growing the plant. This strain has also stoked some ironic controversy over its name -- in Oregon, the state\u2019s Liquor Control Commission banned the sale of Charlotte\u2019s Web and several other strains because their names are potentially appealing to children.

This strain was supposedly the creation of two Californian brothers back in the late 1970s. It is a mix of three other strains Thai (Sativa), Mexican (Sativa) and Afghani (Indica). In its true form, Trainwreck is ninety percent Sativa and only ten percent Indica. As the story goes the two brothers had to pull their crop early because there was a nasty train wreck that happened near their grow site and they didn't want it discovered,\u00a0thus the name. Trainwreck can grow well both indoors and outdoors. Plants of this strain grow fairly tall but the Indica in them causes them fill out well. Inside grown in hydro a single plant can yield up to 500 grams in a square meter. When grown in soil outside Trainwreck plants are ready for harvesting early October and can yield up to 700 grams. This strain flowers somewhere between eight and ten weeks. For the longest time Trainwreck was only available in clone form but more recently a few places have been able to recreate seeds of the strain. There are several others that have tried to imitate the strain under the same name, some with great success. Real Trainwreck will have thin leaves and dense buds full of resin.

One strain was created by Sweet Seeds, and is a cross between two Sensi Seeds parents -- the mostly indica, Afghani landrace-derived Black Domina and the more balanced Jack Herer. The other Black Jack strain (sometimes spelled Blackjack) was created by Nirvana Seeds. This latter Blackjack is a cross between Black Domina and Jock Horror, Nirvana\u2019s own spin on Jack Herer, which is sativa-dominant cross between staple strains Northern Lights, Skunk, and Haze. The THC composition of these Black Jacks cumulatively ranges between 15% and 25%. Black Jack buds of the Nirvana variety tend to be smaller and popcorn-like, with pale green leaves and orange pistils that are covered in trichomes. The nugs of the Sweet Seeds variety on the other hand are larger and denser, sometimes with a purple tint to the leaves. Both varieties are very sticky and difficult to break up by hand. The high resin content of these strains makes them ideal for the production of hash and other THC concentrates. Both Black Jack strains smell and taste of wood and pine, but the Sweet Seeds type carries over the distinctive floral smell of its Jack Herer parent, with fresh grapefruit balanced out by some musk and tobacco. Nirvana's variety, while similar, may also have a hint of berries. The smoke from both Black Jack strains is often described as heavy, but smooth to inhale. Both taste sweets and slightly creamy or malted on the exhale. Sweet Seeds' Black Jack has a high that strikes the user quickly, leading to a sense of heaviness in the head. As it progresses, the effects are generally uplifting, anxiety-reducing and depression-relieving. Users report a lasting sense of focus and motivation, although this energy can veer into jitters and paranoia depending on dosage and individual tolerance. Although there is a mild body high, this strain, like Jack Herer, strikes a very good balance between cerebral and physical effects. Sweet Seeds\u2019 Black Jack is appropriate for daytime use for users looking to complement daily activities or possibly exercise routines. Nirvana's Black Jack has many of these same properties, but coupled with a nice bodily effect, often described as relaxing. The strong pull of this strain may slow users down, but will not necessarily lead to immobilizing couchlock. The sense of physical relaxation can contribute to relief from chronic pain and can also be a remedy for insomnia. The mental effects of Nirvana\u2019s Black Jack are often described as more psychedelic than cerebral -- visual distortions, strong time dilation, and a generally trippy sharpening of the senses may not be uncommon. Because of the possibility of couchlock and this strain\u2019s other disorienting effects, it is recommended for evening or nighttime usage, as a social lubricant or an individual sleep aid. Both the Sweet Seeds and Nirvana Black Jack varieties have a high that is thought to last much longer than average -- from 3 to 4 hours depending on dosage. Either strain of Black Jack can be grown by newcomers to cultivation with relative ease. Both strains can be grown indoors or out. Outdoors, they need consistent but dappled sunlight and a consistent ambient temperature of between 70 and 80 degree Fahrenheit. Indoor growing is convenient, as the plants of both strains tend more towards a bushy indica shape, with moderate height but strong lateral branching. With both strains, expect to see large spaces between the individual bud sites, or nodes, on the stems. Sweet Seeds' Black Jack flowers in just eight to nine weeks indoors. Nirvana's Blackjack, on the other hand, requires between nine and eleven weeks to flower. Because of their complex aromatic genetics, these strains can be very pungent towards the end of the flowering period, which may be a concern for growers looking to keep a low profile. Both have a typically high yield, and can produce up to 500 grams (or about 1 pound) of flowers per square meter. Both Sweet Seeds and Nirvana sell packaged seeds of their proprietary Black Jack varieties online; alternatively, either of these strains can be grown as clones by obtaining a clipping from a healthy, mature plant. Independent of their producers or genetic differences, the Black Jack strains are unique in their boldness. Both are built on sturdy, time-tested strains that impart striking scent and flavor profiles. Both also offer a heavy, steady high that lasts longer than average, providing an economic benefit to the consumer.

In the frenzied market for new crossbred strains, this building block strain - also known as Afghani #1 - can be harder to come by.\u00a0 THC content is high at 15 to 20% and the CBD level is 0.6%. Cured Afghani buds are pale to medium green with a preponderance of orange hairs and a thick coating of trichomes. They should be very resinous and tacky to the touch. This is a famously pungent strain: Afghani nugs have a skunky, diesel-like odor with notes of citrus. The earthy notes are intensified when buds are ground or broken open. As with many indicas, smoke is harsh and thick and can hang in the back of the throat, inducing coughing. Because it\u2019s a pure indica, recreational users of Afghani can expect a deep body high and a general pervasive relaxation. Some users report appetite stimulation as well. Plan on nighttime consumption, either alone or with good friends, as this strain tends towards heavy couchlock and sleepiness.\u00a0 Medicinal effects flow from these same sedative properties. Afghani\u2019s mellow euphoria is useful in the treatment of anxiety and PTSD. The almost narcotic bodily effects can also be used to relieve chronic pain. Above all, this strain is prized for its ability to relieve insomnia and promote deep sleep.\u00a0 \u00a0 Afghani\u2019s high comes on like a wave, gradually rolling over you and easing you into a weighty calm. Mental effects are present, but slight, manifesting more as spacey contentment than as novel thinking or clearheadedness. As users peak, they may experience greater bodily awareness alongside feelings of heavy relaxation. Because this strain does less to promote activity and mobility, it can be beneficial to make sure your surroundings are soothing and familiar before consuming. Afghani is a convenient indoor grow, with its short, bushy stalks ranging between 2 and 4 feet high. Plants can produce a rapid high yield - flowering typically begins around week 8, with a full harvest possible at the 4 month mark. Although the strain is endemic to a mountainous Central Asian climate, it can be grown outdoors along similar latitudes.

Conspiracy Kush is a mostly indica hybrid from Heroes of the Farm, a subset of the growing collective TGA Seeds. Its name is a tongue-in-cheek reference to its genetic lineage: it\u2019s a cross between novelty hybrid Obama Kush and breeder Vic High\u2019s tasty Space Queen. With a memorable aroma and a potent sedative high, this is one flower that deserves to be savored and not quickly consumed. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 puts its THC content at 14% to 25%. Cured flowers of Conspiracy Kush are packaged as small to medium-sized, popcorn-like nuggets. The buds have the tight, dense structure typical of many other indica varieties. The tightly coiled leaves are an earthy shade of yellowish green, although some phenotypes show unexpected shades of purple. This latter, more vibrant color comes about when pigments called anthocyanins are stimulated by cold weather during the growing process -- a transformation similar to the seasonal changes in foliage due to depleted levels of chlorophyll. Depending on individual phenotype, the flowers are coated in milky white trichomes that lend a slightly moist appearance and a sticky texture. When cured properly, Conspiracy Kush smells like fresh citrus. There are also some dank, sickly-sweet odors of overripe fruit. When burnt, this strain gives off a remarkably smooth smoke that has a spicy, peppery aftertaste. Like its Afghani and OG Kush grandparent strains, this pungent flower\u2019s funk can linger for awhile in an enclosed space. Conspiracy Kush has a surprisingly fast onset for an indica. Users may feel a pulsating pressure in the cheeks and temples, accompanied by a dizzying head high. Despite the initial rush, however, this is not an intensely cerebral strain. Mental effects soon give way to a spreading feeling of relaxation and a sleepy, hazy headspace. Users will feel their worries and tensions dissipate as their head and limbs become increasingly heavy. In a comfortable set and setting, Conspiracy Kush can lead to an intractable feeling of couchlock. These restful effects have several benefits for medical cannabis patients. Conspiracy Kush is an effective treatment for aches and pains -- both incidental, as triggered by injury or exercise; and chronic, caused by long-term conditions like fibromyalgia and arthritis. Its calming effects can be helpful in treating some symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. It has also been known to relieve headaches and migraines. In large enough doses, Conspiracy Kush is a potent natural remedy for insomnia. Undesirable side effects include dry mouth and red eyes. Due to this strain\u2019s limited stimulation of the mind, paranoia and anxiety are not commonly reported. TGA Subcool sells seeds of Conspiracy Kush for those interested in growing the strain. It can be cultivated outdoors or indoors. Outdoor growing requires partial humidity and consistent daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Indoors, the strain\u2019s squat and bushy stature -- typical of other indica varieties -- is easily maintained by steady pruning and bending of tender stems early in the vegetative stage. Growers who intend to bring out Conspiracy Kush\u2019s multicolored potential should artificially \u201cshock\u201d the plants by exposing them to colder than average temperatures just before flowering. This strain flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers a low to medium yield of flowers. It\u2019s also a very pungent variety -- growers should invest in odor control measures like carbon filters or exhaust fans for discretion\u2019s sake. Post-harvest, growers should take the time to properly cure their flowers. This two-stage process involves first hanging the buds upside down for 7 to 10 days; ambient humidity should be 50% and the temperature about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Once stems can easily snap off of the flowers, seal the dried buds in airtight jars in ambient humidity of 60-65% and a consistent temperature around 70 degrees. After they\u2019re jarred, buds should be checked at least daily to ensure that they haven\u2019t developed mold. Despite its name, Conspiracy Kush is not likely to leave you trolling Breitbart and Infowars for ridiculous conspiracy theories. Instead, it\u2019ll put you into a thorough and long-lasting body melt.

Although the name Headband may conjure up images of hippies in decorative headgear, it actually refers to the sensation of pressure that builds up around the user\u2019s temples as this strain\u2019s THC dilates blood vessels in the face. Headband is a cross between staple strains OG Kush, Master Kush, and Sour Diesel. All of these indica heavy hitters endow Headband with a high THC content -- it has been measured at between 20% and an impressive 27%. Some sources claim that Headband was developed by Colorado-based breeders Reserva Privada -- who are also responsible for tasty strains like Kandy Kush and Strawberry Banana. Still others attest to an origin in 707 Headband, a grassroots strain developed in the cannabis promised land of Humboldt County, California; breeders DNA Genetics claim to have studied this \u201c707\u201d strain and recreated its likely genetic profile to produce Headband. Buds of Headband are small and are more like nuggets than dense, spade-like cones. The leaves are an even, pale green, although some plant phenotypes have a higher propensity for shades of purple (the result of cold temperatures activating anthocyanin compounds during the vegetative period). As might be expected of a strain with such high THC, Headband flowers are covered in silvery-white trichomes and are sticky to the touch -- this is one strain that proves difficult to breakup for joints or pipes without using a grinder. The initial smell of the cured flowers is tangy and lemony. Underneath these dominant scents is a faint skunkiness, along with some notes of pine. Unlike some other indicas -- particularly OGs -- Headband produces smoke that is thick but surprisingly smooth. This smoke has a rounded, creamy mouthfeel and tastes citrusy when inhaled. On the exhale, a more diesel, chemical funk is present. The overall taste sensation is of lemon-scented cleaning fluid that hits the user at the front of the palate. The high from Headband mounts slowly, with some users reporting that they may not notice effects for up to 20 minutes after consuming. With very little sativa effects, Headband induces a spacey, foggy state that makes it poorly suited to tasks that require focus and mental acuity. In addition to this fogginess, Headband gives users a physically weighty feeling that spreads down through the spine and radiates out to the limbs, comfortably locking them into supine position. This sense of couchlock makes Headband ideal for passive activities in comfortable surroundings, like watching movies or listening to music. It could also serve as inspiration for some general creative thinking. The psychedelic sense of disconnection from one\u2019s own body makes Headband a potential aphrodisiac as well. Medically speaking, Headband\u2019s powerful sedative properties serve as a remedy for mild anxiety and, in large enough doses, for chronic insomnia. Fans of the strain have also reported improvement in symptoms associated with migraines and muscle spasms. Headband has been known to provoke appetite, making it a supplementary treatment for users suffering from decreased hunger due to disease or chemotherapy. Negative side effects include a feeling of dizziness, drymouth, and -- thanks to the same expansion of blood vessels that causes this strain\u2019s trademark facial pressure -- red eyes. The high from Headband is said to last longer than average, even in users with a relatively high tolerance for THC. Perhaps because of its sturdy genetic profile, Headband produces versatile plants that can be grown by those with limited to moderate experience. It is not as vulnerable as many other strains to mold or disease; it can also withstand some degree of temperature variation. This heartiness makes Headband a solid outdoor crop in warm temperate climates. Headband can also be easily grown indoors: its plants have a characteristic indica shape, with a shorter than average height and a bushy silhouette. In order to let light reach low-growing flowering nodes, growers should attempt to trim any broad fan leaves -- but they may not find many, due to this strain\u2019s low leaf-to-bud ratio. Grown indoors, Headband flowers within 10 to 11 weeks. It produces higher than average yields. Finally, because it is so skunky and potent, growers of Headband may want to take some extra caution with plants -- isolating outdoor growing locations and installing odor control measures indoor growing environments. Headband is a potent strain that will please cannabis novices and enthusiasts alike. Providing the best of what indicas have to offer, it\u2019s a surefire path to relaxation, mild creativity, and an overall trippy good time, either alone or in the company of good friends. Although it has an appealing citrus flavor, this novelty doesn\u2019t come at the expense of genetic stability or potency as with many new crossbreeds in the cannabis market today. Headband\u2019s high trichome composition also makes it an easy choice for the production of hash and other THC concentrates."], "attributes": {"anxiety": 80, "pain": 100, "relaxed": 60, "euphoric": 80, "creative": 100, "focused": 40, "appetite": 40, "cotton mouth": 40, "depression": 60, "nausea": 20}}], "phantom kush": [{"source": "FOURTWENTY101", "kind": [50, 50, 1], "description": "The one and only Ken Estes of Grand Daddy Purple Seed\\'s brings to the world the super frosty and extremely hard hitting hybrid known rightfully as, \"Phantom Kush\" due to it\\'s powerful effects that seem to sneak up on you like a ghost in the night.

Bred by Canadian seed bank BC Bud Depot, it is a cross between perennial favorite Girl Scout Cookies and indica hybrid Fire OG. Animal Cookies has definite \u201cbag appeal\u201d for consumers, with multicolored flowers and a complex sweet-sour scent. It has heavy, almost narcotic indica effects, providing pain relief, relaxation, and sleep. Cannabis lab Analytical 360 has tested samples of Animal Cookies and measured its THC content at between 18% and an impressive 27%. Animal Cookies is marked by small to medium-sized popcorn-like buds with a dense bud structure typical of other indicas. Leaves are a yellowish-green; some phenotypes can express subtle purple hues. This purple is brought out when colder temperatures stimulate pigments called anthocyanins -- the process is similar to the way foliage changes color in autumn when chlorophyll breaks down in cooler weather. The buds are very sticky and covered in white to cloudy amber trichomes, perhaps lending the leaves their yellowish appearance. Orange hairs -- which are actually pistils to collect pollen from male plants -- stand out against the colorful flowers. Animal Cookies has a scent that is simultaneously sweet and sour, with a dank, skunky edge. Breaking open the sticky flowers yields some more notes of pepper and pine. Interestingly, this strain is not known for having a grape-like taste; although its pigments bring out purple hues in the right conditions, this does not result in a corresponding change in flavor. When combusted, Animal Cookies have a thick, harsh smoke that often induces coughing. This smoke has a sweet and vaguely spicy taste when exhaled. Animal Cookies has a high that settles in fairly quickly for a predominantly indica strain. Smokers may not have finished coughing before they\u2019re hit with a weighty and palpable stoney feeling that affects the entire body. Emotional well-being accompanies this relaxation so that users typically feel remarkably comfortable and contented. Without any cerebral intensity, this strain does not confer the kind of rapid-association thoughtfulness that comes with more pure sativa varieties. The extreme relaxation that Animal Cookies provides can melt into a powerful couchlock if users continue to indulge in its potent bud. These physical effects also make Animal Cookies an effective painkiller with medical application. Those suffering from both mild or more chronic, nerve-based pain report an easing or a total relief of symptoms. This strain\u2019s heaviness also makes it an excellent treatment for users who struggle with insomnia. Mentally, Animal Cookies can also be beneficial in helping treat stress and anxiety, as it renders users happily oblivious in its stoney haze. Side effects include the typical dry eyes and dry mouth, along with some appetite stimulation. More recommended for nighttime than daytime use, Animal Cookies is not usually praised for helping users accomplish work. This strain can be difficult to grow, and is not recommended for newcomers to cultivation. Better nurtured indoors than out, Animal Cookies\u2019 plants tend to be a synthesis of indica and sativa varieties, with plants that grow tall but also have bushy and horizontally-spreading lateral branches. Fortunately, it responds if users bend and trim the stems and branches, growing accordingly to fit the surrounding space. Growers should also be sure to trim any broad fan leaves growing near the top of the plant, so as to allow light and air to circulate to the lower branches and flowering nodes. Animal Cookies reaches the flowering stage within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and offers a higher than average yield. Growers should keep in mind that this is a very pungent strain, even in the vegetative stage, and those looking to keep their operations discreet should put odor control measures in place like carbon air filters. Animal Cookies can be grown as clones, from clippings taken from mature plants; alternatively, seeds of this strain can be purchased online from breeder BC Bud Depot. With a well-rounded, hashy taste and a heavy body stone, Animal Cookies has the best of what indica varieties have to offer. Its memorable name, conjuring nostalgia for childhood snacks, also means it is likely to have continued popularity.

Unidentified breeders in Topeka, Kansas -- an area not usually thought of as a cannabis hot spot -- found that a male plant of hybrid Hawaiian/Romulan had fertilized a female plant of sativa Island Sweet Skunk. The result was a strain with colorful flowers and high trichome production that\u2019s come to be known as Golden Goat. This happy accident is valued for its strong and well-balanced high and its soothing analgesic properties. Golden Goat has 1% of pain-relieving CBD in its genes, as well as THC composition that averages about 16% but can test as high as 23%. Golden Goat has dense and medium-sized buds that have a solidly indica appearance, with heavy and tightly-packed leaves. Its leaves are a bright green with some hints of pink or red in certain phenotypes -- these varied hues are the result of pigments called anthocyanins being activated by unusually cold weather during the plants\u2019 vegetative state. The flowers are also very resinous and coated in amber-colored trichomes that give the cured buds the golden glow that\u2019s referenced in this strain\u2019s name. When grown and cured properly, buds are very sticky and when handled will leave behind a good amount of residue. Adding to Golden Goat\u2019s bag appeal is a strong and complex scent. The initial impression is fruity and tropical, as is typical of Hawaiian landrace-descended strains like Mango. This citrus profile exists alongside a more sour tinge, likely the result of the Island Sweet Skunk parent strain. To round this all out, buds can smell spicy and earthy when burned. All of these notes come together in a strong and acrid smoke that can sting the eyes and tickle the throat, causing users to cough. Although some find it pleasant, others have described Golden Goat\u2019s scent and taste as a clash of incompatible flavors, leading to some conjecture that the \u201cgoat\u201d in its name is actually meant to describe this strain\u2019s taste. This is an especially pungent variety, so smokers looking to maintain discretion should plan accordingly. Golden Goat has a high that creeps up gradually instead of hitting users right away. It begins as a buzzy sativa-like high marked by altered perception; users may sense a magnification of their surroundings with sharper sounds and enhanced colors. In a short amount of time, though, this sensory distortion mellows out into physical relaxation. Users feel a kind of calm radiating from the neck down through the limbs, which allows for a grounding that stops the sativa side of the high from becoming too disorienting. Although relaxing, the body stone from Golden Goat isn\u2019t so heavy that it will induce couchlock -- smokers can still be as mobile as they\u2019d like, making this a great strain for daytime or nighttime use. Golden Goat has some medical benefits as well, conferred by small amounts of the cannabinoid CBD as well as by the sedative indica effects. The simultaneous feelings of emotional uplift and physical relaxation can be helpful in regulating the symptoms of anxiety, depression, or even PTSD. Its mildly painkilling effects can also be useful for relieving chronic aches and pains. Finally, if consumed in large enough doses, Golden Goat can provide the full sedative effects necessary to put users into a restful sleep, thus tempering the difficult symptoms of insomnia. Although its high tends to be shorter than average, lasting between 1.5 to 2.5 hours, Golden Goat\u2019s high THC content may lead some to moderate their dosage -- a little bit can go a long way. Golden Goat is a clone-only strain, meaning that in order to cultivate it, growers can\u2019t purchase packaged seeds, but instead need to obtain and transplant clippings from mature Golden Goat plants. While it can be successfully grown outdoors or indoors, the characteristically sativa height of its plants may make outdoor growing a more appealing option. That said, those looking to grow this or any other cannabis strain outdoors will need to ensure consistent sunlight and temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Because they are tall and wispy with widely-spaced flowering nodes, Golden Goat plants may not require growers to trim broad fan leaves during the vegetative stage. As with many other sativas, the flowering period can be long, happening within 9 to 11 weeks.

Fortunately, this strain has a stoney potency to match its risque marketing. Bordello\u2019s origins are something of a mystery, with no official commercial presence or documentation to point to its creators. However, it is rumored within digital cannabis cultivation forums to be the brainchild of a breeder named Lonestar who is associated with a collective called the Texas Resin Company. Bordello is said to be a cross between two other strains of mysterious provenance -- Blueberry Apocalypse and Alexis. Bordello\u2019s THC content has been reported to be between 15% and 20%. Bordello\u2019s flowers, though colorful, are not especially eye-catching in terms of size or structure. They are small to medium and hold fragmented, popcorn-like shapes when cured. The tight, classically indica buds are dusted with trichomes, giving them a slightly moist texture and appearance. Leaves are forest green, in contrast to their hairy, bright orange pistils. Many phenotypes of Bordello also appear to show streaks of lavender and violet. The strain\u2019s genetics are predisposed to produce these purple colors because of high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins; the pigments yield bright colors when exposed to colder than average conditions late in the growing process. A complex scent and flavor profile makes the mystery of Bordello\u2019s genetics all the more tantalizing. The flowers give a powerfully tangy citrus scent, reminiscent of Haze varieties like Jack Herer. Consumers may also detect notes of berry, perhaps passed on from the so-called Blueberry Apocalypse parent strain. When broken up or ground, the buds have more of an herbal funk. Bordello gives off a particularly smooth smoke for an indica, and tastes fruity and vaguely piney on the exhale. Notably, this strain does not have a grape flavor to match its purple hues; compounds called terpenes, distinct from the aforementioned anthocyanin pigments, are responsible for Bordello\u2019s nuanced scent and taste. Bordello has a heavy, languorous high that may take a while to be fully felt. After a few minutes -- or after a second hit -- smokers may feel a mounting pressure around the eyes and sinuses. Rather than plunging into cerebral intensity, however, users will slide into a pleasantly hazy mindset. Palpable relaxation creeps throughout the body, slowing breathing and releasing muscle tension. This newfound sedation can create some confusion and brain fog. This strain is not the best choice for accomplishing tasks that require significant exertion. That said, Bordello may provide sufficient relaxation for users to feel friendly and chatty -- even those with social anxiety disorders. Because it can be somewhat incapacitating, Bordello is not recommended for morning or afternoon use, and is better suited to helping users unwind before bed. Bordello\u2019s sedative effects also make it an effective treatment for all kinds of ailments. Its body buzz can numb both moderate and several aches and pains. It can even have anti-convulsive properties for those with seizure conditions. Bordello\u2019s easy feeling of contentment is very useful for soothing stress, anxiety, and depression, and in high enough doses can even provide relief from insomnia. Seeds of this strain are not available for commercial sale. Those who wish to grow Bordello at home must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow \u201cclones,\u201d or genetically identical propagations. Because of this strain\u2019s limited documentation, there isn\u2019t much information on its ideal growing conditions. However, because it\u2019s an indica, Bordello likely has a short, bushy plant structure that can easily be grown indoors. If they\u2019re able to foster clones, growers should trim any broad, light-blocking fan leaves in order to allow low-growing nodes to reach maximum flowering potential. Growers should also accentuate this strain\u2019s purple highlights by exposing the plants to cold nighttime temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Bordello is reported to have an average yield of 36 grams (or 1.4 ounces) per square foot of plant. Despite its obscurity, Bordello is an excellent choice for intimate nighttime relaxation. Its dynamic, citrus-inflected taste also makes it a novel strain to share with good friends. Whatever you do, though, don\u2019t plan on having an active or mobile smoke session -- Bordello allows you to lounge in sleepy, heavy-bodied luxury."], "attributes": {"anxiety": 100, "pain": 60, "insomnia": 60, "arthritis": 20, "sleepy": 80, "euphoric": 100, "sedated": 60, "cotton mouth": 20, "depression": 80, "dry eyes": 20}}], "midas": [{"source": "FOURTWENTY101", "kind": [0, 100, 1], "description": "This Albert Walker and Nevil\\'s Wreck hybrid known simply as, \"Midas\" is a high yielding and fast finishing Sativa dominant hybrid that was brought forth by the world class breeders at Rare Dankness Seed\\'s in Colorado.

This strain is the creation of Granddaddy Purple, a breeding collective based in Northern California who also claim responsibility for the eponymous Grandaddy Purple strain. Bay Dream is a cross between the wildly popular Blue Dream and Grandaddy Purple Collective\u2019s own fruity sativa Bay 11. This is a tasty, energizing strain that\u2019s perfect for waking and baking or socializing. Cannabis testing lab Analytics 360 has measured the THC composition of Bay Dream flowers at between a modest 12% and an impressive 26%. Bay Dream is marked by its visually striking, medium-sized nuggets. The flowers have a relatively loose bud structure, typical of sativas, with soft and pliable leaves. The leaves themselves are predominantly light green, although some phenotypes of the strain may show traces of faint to dark purple. These purple hues are the result of anthocyanin pigments in the plant\u2019s genetics which trigger a color change when plants stimulated by cold temperatures. The colorful flowers are accented by pale yellow pistils, meant to catch pollen from male plants. Leaves are also frosted with trichomes which make the soft leaves very sticky to the touch. When cured properly, buds have a complex aroma that blends the unique scents of both parent strains -- Blue Dream imparts some fruity, berry-like tang and Bay 11 gives a little bit of pine. When this strain is combusted, smoke is smooth and has more of a citrus smell and taste that hits the front of the tongue. This strain has a high that builds slowly for a sativa, starting with some changes in breathing and soon making itself known as a pressure around the temples. Users feel a more intense awareness of their surrounding and may feel more talkative. Depending on the individual user\u2019s level of experience with cannabis and tendency towards anxiety, Bay Dream may be powerfully disorienting in this sense. The feeling of having a loud inner monologue, a common effect of many strong sativas, is often reported. In a positive and familiar environment, users can direct this high towards creative pursuits. It\u2019s also a great strain for working on tasks that involve problem solving, as it encourages non-traditional and lateral thinking. In social contexts, Bay Dream facilitates conversation because of the way it induces free association. This strain\u2019s cerebral properties makes it an effective treatment for some cognitive and mood disorders. Its feeling of immediacy can be a boon to patients suffering from depression or stress, helping them to be generally more present and mindful. Its sense of focus can also be good for those with attention deficit disorders. Bay Dream has relatively few pain-relieving effects, but it has some physical usefulness in its ability to increase energy, motivating some people to exercise. It can also be a strong appetite stimulant. As mentioned, because it encourages rapid-fire and recursive thinking, this may not be the best option for those prone to anxiety. Bay Dream is also not an ideal nighttime smoke, as it may leave users feeling wired and alert. A rare strain to come by, Bay Dream is only available as a clone from fellow growers; breeders Grandaddy Purple Collective have not directly packaged and released seeds its seeds for sale. Bay Dream can be can be grown indoors or outdoors, although outdoor growing requires warm and humid Mediterranean-like temperatures with daytime temperatures in the 70-80 degree Fahrenheit range. Indoor, plants can be easily managed, as they reach a medium height and can be trained by pruning and bending early on in the vegetative stage. Topping -- or trimming the broad fan leaves that grow at the top of the plant -- can help low-lying buds get the air and sunlight they need. Growers may also want to expose Bay Dream plants to cold temperatures just before the flowering stage in order to bring open it visually appealing trademark purple hues.

It was originally created by breeders in a neighborhood of Oakland, California dubbed Oaksterdam, one of the oldest legal medical marijuana areas of the United States. Purple Kush is a cross between two South-Central Asian indica landraces: Hindu Kush, from the mountainous Pakistan-Afghanistan border, and a purple-tinged variety of Afghani. With 100% indica genetics, it provides a slow and relaxing full body stone. Named a Top 10 Kush Strain by High Times magazine in 2016, Purple Kush has THC composition ranging from 17% to as much as 27%. This strain has medium sized, popcorn-like flowers when cured, with a very dense, heavy bud structure. Depending on the phenotype, leaves can be equal parts green and purple. The tendency towards purple, selectively bred from the Purple Afghani parent strain, comes about when the plant\u2019s anthocyanins -- pigments similar to chlorophyll -- are activated in cold growing conditions. This process is similar to the breakdown of chlorophyll and the stimulation of red and yellow pigments that causes foliage to change colors in autumn. As with parent strain Afghani, Purple Kush also has a very high capacity to create sticky resin, making it valuable in the production of hash and other concentrates. The tightly-curled flowers are covered in trichomes, giving the green and purple leaves a dewy white sheen. Orange pistils, intended to catch pollen from male plants, stand out against the already-colorful flowers. Purple Kush\u2019s bag appeal isn\u2019t only limited to visuals -- the buds also have have a standout taste. The initial impression is similar to the odor of Afghani strains, with an earthy, almost sandalwood musk. Closer inspection brings out sweet and fruity notes of grape. When combusted, the flowers have a simultaneously fruity and hash-like odor and smoke, which can sting sinuses and bring about heavy coughing. On the exhale, smoke from Purple Kush has a sugary grape-like taste that may remind some of sweet dessert wine or purple cough syrup. Unlike some hybrids that start off with a disorienting head high that melts into a slow sense of calm, Purple Kush eases users straight into physical relaxation. Although there may be some mental effects, they have more of a psychedelic, distorted nature than a cerebral one. Smokers may appreciate the calming effects of music or of tactile surroundings. Rather than stimulate hyperactive thoughts and sharp focus, however, this strain is more likely to bring about a state of dopey contentedness. The perma-smile and heavy body stone that come with Purple Kush definitely call for nighttime enjoyment of this indica knockout. Purple Kush can also effective as a medication. Its powerfully sedative effects can blunt some symptoms of anxiety and depression. It can also be surprisingly effective in relieving pain -- both situational, like the aches that set in after a workout, or chronic, like the nerve-related pain that comes with cancer or fibromyalgia. In large enough doses, Purple Kush is also a great way to treat entrenched insomnia. The strain\u2019s high is said to have an average duration of 2 to 3 hours. As might be expected of a purely indica plant, Purple Kush grows low and bushy. Those looking to cultivate their own plants of the strain may have success outdoors or indoors, but may have more success indoors where they can control the growing conditions. Large numbers of plants can easily fit within a vertically-limited grow space, as they seldom exceed 3 feet in height. In order to bring out Purple Kush\u2019s trademark purple hues for its full visual potential, growers may also want to shock the plants and activate the anthocyanins by exposing them to cold temperatures; however, growers should be sure to only take this step shortly before harvesting so as not to reduce the plant\u2019s overall yield. Purple Kush plants flower within 8 weeks when grown indoors and in mid to late September when grown outdoors. Under ideal conditions, growers can expect a moderate yield of about 37 grams (or 1.3 ounces) per square footage of plant. Finally, those who have successfully harvested a crop of Purple Kush will want to properly cure their buds to preserve the colorful and tasty flowers -- all that\u2019s required is hanging the buds upside down for about a week in a room that maintains 50% humidity and a consistent temperature of 70 degree Fahrenheit and then sealing the dried buds in wide-mouthed jars in ambient surroundings of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and between 60-65% humidity. Purple Kush has the special distinction of being visually striking and boldly flavored without sacrificing genetic stability -- unlike many hybrids that are specifically crossbred for taste, this strain has roots that stick as closely as possible to the cannabis species\u2019 origins in Asia. It\u2019s no wonder the variety has spawned popular imitations like Las Vegas Purple Kush.

It was produced by Dutch veterans Green House Seeds in the 1990s as a cross between Brazilian indica and South Indian sativa landraces. At the time, the underground cannabis market consisted mostly of early hybrids like Northern Lights and Haze, but White Widow has since joined the ranks of these legendary strains, winning an early High Times Cannabis Cup in 1995 and several awards since. Bred specifically for a high trichome count, White Widow is especially valued in the production of hash. This strain has an average THC composition of 20%, with some phenotypes exceeding that amount. Buds of White Widow are chunky and somewhat conical and tapered. The bud structure of the flowers are more sativa than indica, with a loose and fluffy texture that can be broken up somewhat easily despite its stickiness. The leaves are spring green with few visible pistils. When grown successfully, buds are entirely covered in long-stalked trichomes, lending the whitish-gray appearance that gives the strain its memorable name. White Widow is known for having a stinging, ammonia-like scent with some hints of earthy pine. Breaking buds open gives off a more hashy, incense-like odor. The smooth smoke tastes similarly earthy -- users accustomed to fruity or tasty crossbreeds may be disappointed by White Widow\u2019s relative lack of flavor. That said, White Widow is especially pungent when combusted, so smokers worried about discretion should plan accordingly. What this strain lacks in flavor profile, it makes up for in quick-acting cerebral effects. Users can become more acutely perceptive of their surroundings, tuned into sounds and patterns that may have gone unnoticed before. Enthusiasts also describe an almost immediate uplift in mood and an energy and focus that can applied to either mundane tasks like cleaning or more complex problem-solving processes. White Widow can also be creatively valuable, inducing a kind of rapid-fire thought association that can open up some previously unexplored territory. Psychedelic effects like visual distortion and increased perception can amplify the impact of music or art, while a very mild body buzz mellows users out. Because of its deeply cerebral effects, this strain is typically more psychologically than physically helpful. It can aid those with attention deficit disorders in sustaining focus on a single topic. It can also boost energy in cases of fatigue or depression. Some users have even described White Widow as efficient in relieving migraines. Because of its potency, the introspective mind-race associated with White Widow can sometimes veer into paranoia, and smokers may want to plan dosage accordingly. White Widow can be grown from seed or from clone (achieved by planting clippings of mature and healthy plants). It is a mold-resistant strain, making outdoor cultivation an option -- although an almost Mediterranean climate with constant temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit works best. Despite a mostly sativa high, White Widow look much more indica during the vegetative stage: plants are bushy and wide, and rarely exceed 6 feet in height. The plants flower within 9 weeks when grown indoors and are ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors. Growers can expect about 37 to 55 grams (or about 1.3 to 2 ounces) per square foot of plant. As if the Dutch reputation for quality cannabis breeding hadn\u2019t already been established with highly successful strains like Big Bud, White Widow shows off the excellent results of studied and deliberate cultivation in the Netherlands. The super-sticky strain provides a cerebral high that, while sometimes daunting in large doses, mostly allows users to remain functional and aware of their surroundings. An excellent choice for chatty social use, this strain is an all-purpose perennial favorite. Its strong genetic foundation -- it is crossed from Brazilian and South Asian landraces -- has made White Widow a valuable plant for experimentation in crossbreeding; among others, it has yielded increasingly popular hybrids like White Russian and The White."], "attributes": {"anxiety": 80, "pain": 100, "energetic": 40, "relaxed": 40, "euphoric": 100, "creative": 60, "appetite": 20, "cotton mouth": 20, "depression": 60, "nausea": 20}}], "acdc": [{"source": "QANNABIS", "kind": [50, 50, 0], "description": "ACDC, a sativa-dominant phenotype of the high-CBD strain, Cannatonic, is a popular strain in California.

Despite its fame, though, its exact origins remain a mystery. Some claim that it\u2019s a cross between staple Chemdawg and a hardy Hindu Kush landrace. It\u2019s also possible that OG Kush emerged from undocumented bag seed as a distinct phenotype of some other existing strain. The meaning of its name is also disputed -- the \u201cOG\u201d has been alternately said to stand for: \u201coriginal gangster,\u201d connoting its status as an old-school building block strain; \u201cocean grown,\u201d in reference to its origin along the California coast; and even \u201cOverGrown.com,\u201d a now-defunct website that served as a resource for countless cannabis growers. \u00a0One thing that\u2019s not up for debate is OG Kush\u2019s potency -- its THC composition has been consistently measured at between 20% and 25%. OG Kush has medium to large nugget-like buds that have a dense, indica-like structure. The leaves are yellowish green, although certain phenotypes can show traces of purple; the latter color is the result of anthocyanin pigments being activated by cold weather. Vibrant orange pistils, meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants, stand out against these colorful flowers. The buds are covered in trichomes that lend them a silvery-white appearance and make them very sticky to the touch -- when prepping buds for a joint or a pipe, users may want to use a grinder. When properly cured, the buds have a earthy, musty scent that is accented by some citrusy brightness: the overall impression is of a hoppy craft beer. Burning or breaking open the buds offers more of a pine-like odor. Smoke from OG Kush is commonly harsh and cough-inducing; it may sting the sinuses and cause eyes to water. The smoke tastes hashy and spicy like a classic indica on the inhale and exhale. OG Kush\u2019s pungent funk may linger for a while after a joint has been extinguished -- those looking to remain discreet about their smoking should take the proper precautions. The high from OG Kush is more head-focused than physical. It starts with a sudden headrush that may lead users to feel more focused on their surroundings; sounds and colors may seem intensified. This alteration of the senses may soon give way to a general uplift in mood that progresses towards euphoria. The increase in focus is not as cerebral as with more pure sativas -- smokers will not suffer from a disorienting sense of rapid thought association or \u201cmindrace.\u201d \u00a0It\u2019s a versatile smoke that lends itself to the user\u2019s mood and mindset The combination of mental stimulation and improvement in mood makes this a uniquely social strain, good for parties and lively conversations. It\u2019s also a great way to enhance activities that involve the body and mind, like video games, exercise, and even sex. OG Kush has medical application as a means to temporarily relieve anxiety and depression by helping users live in the moment. Its sense of focus can also be helpful for those suffering from attention deficit disorders. Some have reported relief from headaches and migraines with this strain as well. As with many sativa varieties, OG Kush has the potential to make users feel paranoid with higher doses. OG Kush can be grown indoors or outdoors. Outdoor cultivation requires consistent temperatures around 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Indoor growing tends to be more convenient for many, as plants are typically short and bushy, growing between 2 and 3.5 feet tall. Topping -- trimming the broad fan leaves that grow towards the top of the plant -- can help light and air reach flowering nodes on the lower branches. Plants of OG Kush flower within 9 weeks when grown indoors; growers can expect an average yield of about 45 grams or 1.6 ounces per square foot. This strain\u2019s pungency also means that those looking to isolate the odors of their grow space should invest in measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans. Because of its mildly energizing and uplifting effects, OG Kush is a strain best enjoyed in the daytime or early evening. Its positive high can be enjoyed in festive social settings or alone, for accomplishing any variety of tasks. It also has the genetic stability to back up its popularity -- OG Kush has been a building block, yielding successful crossbreeds like Bubba Kush and also offering up some distinct phenotypes that have become popular strain in their own right, like Tahoe OG and Alpha OG."], "attributes": {"anxiety": 80, "pain": 80, "relaxed": 80, "euphoric": 100, "sedated": 40, "appetite": 60, "dry eyes": 20, "cotton mouth": 20, "depression": 100, "nausea": 40}}], "thc bomb": [{"source": "QANNABIS", "kind": [40, 60, 0], "description": "This strain provides a relaxing anti-anxiety medicinal effect.

This premium fan-favorite, Sativa dominant strain, staying literal to its name\u00a0was born from a cross between Hawaiian and Haze genetics. It has a staggering THC content of 26%. It is rumored that it was first grown in the rich, volcanic soil of Hawaii, and that is the reason behind this strain being so delightful. Hawaiian Haze plants grow tall. The bright green buds are narrow and cylindrical, and are light, airy, and dense with a good trichome covering. The long and curly orange hairs, combined with the elegant and thin leaves, make the plant a sight to behold. In terms of smell, the Hawaiian Haze is exactly what the name suggests. The blast of tropical flowery and fruity scent that hits users are nothing short of joyful, and this extravagance is carried on to the taste.\u00a0 The taste of this strain is a wonderful combination of tropical flowers, like lavenders, and fruits such as pineapples and peaches. This exotic combination of smell and taste is what makes the Hawaiian Haze a true A-lister. Not only does the Hawaiian Haze have a fine taste, but it also has a lot of traits which make it suitable for recreational use. For instance, it induces a highly enjoyable and trippy head buzz which takes users for a joyride through the clouds. It also makes users feel happy, energetic, relaxed, and elated and uplifts mood. Many users have also reported to feeling more social and talkative thanks to this strain, which makes it perfect for daytime use. It does equally well in the medicinal benefits department. Hawaiian Haze helps to alleviate depression, stress, nausea, fatigue and lack of appetite. This adds yet another feather in its cap.\u00a0 Bred by Abraxas Seeds, this strain has an average yield \u2013 roughly 250-350g per square meter in a Sea of Green system. It flowers slowly, taking as much as 14 weeks, and harvests in late November. The seed should be grown under a 12/12 regimen of light indoors, to obtain a satisfactory yield.

More experienced users report a rise in creativity and intellectual curiosity. Negative effects may include the usual dry eyes and mouth when Master Kush is smoked. Some patients also experience dizziness, paranoia, and anxiety with higher doses or when Master Kush is consumed as an edible. This strain's main use is for relieving stress and anxiety. The strong, Indica-based effects are ideal for relaxing in the evening. Master Kush is extremely effective in the treatment of insomnia. Its body-numbing high can help manage chronic pain.

Breeder DNA Genetics (who may also be responsible for stabilizing the strain Headband) created Chocolope as a cross between flavorful favorite Chocolate Thai and Cannalope Haze. The result is a dynamic, energizing sativa that has won over many followers. Chocolate is a more unusual taste in the portfolio of cannabis varieties -- landrace parent strain Chocolate Thai may have achieved this flavor through some combination of terpene production and terroir, picking up nutrients from the fertile soil also used to grow coffee. Chocolate Thai was extremely popular in the U.S. in the 1980s. Similarly, Chocolope has won several honors in the High Times Cannabis Cup and the High Life Cup, and was featured on the cover of High Times magazine as Strain of the Year in 2007. Samples of Chocolope have tested at between 17% and 22% THC composition. Chocolope has long, fluffy buds that take an almost cylindrical shape, unlike the nugget-like buds of more indica varieties. Leaves are dark green and relatively loosely-packed; although they can be very sticky, they\u2019re typically easier to break up than pure indica strains and may or may not require a grinder. Pistils tend to be a vivid orange. The cured buds have a particularly dank, earthy smell with some sweetness. When buds are broken up and combusted, this earthy scent is somewhat more intense. The smoke from this strain hits smoothly -- on the inhale, it bears more resemblance to parent strain Cannalope Haze and tastes mostly fruity with some hints of chocolate. Cocoa and coffee notes are more evident as smoke is exhaled. The mental high of Chocolope takes hold quickly. Users may notice a buzzy head high that soon morphs into an altered way of thinking. With virtually none of the heavy body stone associated with hybrids or indicas, Chocolope\u2019s effect is motivating and energizing. Although it\u2019s cerebral and thought-provoking, this strain allows the user to maintain a mostly clear and level head. Well suited to daytime use, it can easily accompany household tasks or more extensive errands. Medically speaking, Chocolope\u2019s acute sense of focus can be good for those with attention deficit disorders. The emotional high and general sense of well-being may also be helpful in treating stress, anxiety, and even symptoms associated with PTSD. Despite its potency, though, many users report that the high from Chocolope lasts shorter than average. Chocolope has some peculiarities that may make it a difficult strain for beginners to cultivate. As with many other purer sativas, plants can be very tall. But although outdoor environments can provide all the necessary vertical space, the strain is prone to mold, meaning that growers will need to keep a close eye on growing conditions, especially in humid areas. Indoor cultivation allows for more climate control, but presents the problem of space. That said, growers can tame the exceptional height of these plants by bending and pruning stems early in the vegetative stage. Whether indoors or outdoors, growers who supplement the plants\u2019 feeding regimen with nutrient mixes may find that Chocolope plants have an exceptional thirst, showing signs of nutrient deficiency until properly fed. Finally, this strain has a very long flowering time. Parent strain Chocolate Thai is responsible for this lag, with a notoriously long flowering period of 14 weeks: the crossing of Chocolate Thai with Cannalope Haze allows Chocolope to have a shorter, although still significant flowering time of 10 to 12 weeks. When grown outdoors, Chocolope reaches maturity and is ready for harvest in late October to early November. This extended flowering period can be worth the wait: Chocolope may yield as much as 60 grams (or 2 ounces) per square foot. The bracing cerebral properties of Chocolope make it a great wake and bake strain. It may be a happy accident that this variety\u2019s flavors of cantaloupe and cocoa are a perfect fit for a breakfast meal! Low-key nighttime use of Chocolope is discouraged, as its energy and potency can have counterproductive effects on the sleep cycle. On the other hand, it makes a great social lubricant and its novelty scent and taste are bound to turn some heads. Chocolope is a great example of how crossbreeding genetically-perfected landrace strains can yield a product that is as powerful as it is aesthetically appealing."], "attributes": {"anxiety": 80, "pain": 20, "energetic": 80, "euphoric": 80, "creative": 100, "focused": 60, "paranoia": 20, "appetite": 40, "depression": 100, "nausea": 40}}], "titanium": [{"source": "WIKILEAF", "kind": [50, 50, 0], "description": ["There are two different strains that call themselves Titanium.

The OG strains are very popular in California where a simple formula has brought great results. Since the 1990s, breeders have taken a strain and crossed it with OG Kush, developing the genetics over time and producing reliable and potent strains. These strains are distinguished from others due to their terpene profile, which characteristically includes caryophyllene and myrcene, giving it the familiar floral and diesel aroma.\u00a0 Zombie OG is dank bud with a multi-dimensional flavor profile. Aromas such as pine, earth, and lavender tease the nose and delight the palate. Buds are on the small side. They are dense and bright green with orange hairs. White trichomes and resin are plentiful.\u00a0 Recreational users can expect a couch-locking experience as the weed hits the body hard with sedation and sleepiness. You may feel some euphoria in the head while the body says not now, later. One way to use this strain\u00a0is for introspection - lay on the bank of a river and contemplate your existence and then go home and have the best sleep of your life! Deep and peaceful sleep is the promise to medical patients as well as a pain-free existence. People with stress, depression, insomnia, and anxiety will all find something to like in Zombie OG. People suffering from wasting diseases or undergoing chemotherapy may find that they are much more likely to visit the fridge or cupboard for some delicious munchies.\u00a0 Zombie OG is not one of the easiest seeds or plants to find. Search for relatives like Zombie Kush or others in the Zombie or OG family. Grow it indoors, outdoors, or in a greenhouse. This plant yields high in the harvest with dense buds. Novice growers can attempt it. Expect average height plants and flowering in 9 weeks, which is a bit longer than other cannabis strains.\u00a0 Named for the zombie-like state this strain will put you in, Zombie OG is a favorite of recreational and medical users that just happen to be in the market for a peaceful weed coma."], "attributes": {"anxiety": 80, "pain": 80, "insomnia": 100, "relaxed": 100, "sleepy": 80, "euphoric": 80, "sedated": 80, "appetite": 40, "cotton mouth": 20, "depression": 60}}], "gourdbuster": [{"source": "QANNABIS", "kind": [0, 0, -1], "description": "\\xa0", "attributes": {}}], "chem #4 x chocolate thai": [{"source": "FOURTWENTY101", "kind": [0, 100, 1], "description": "In this exotic and hard hitting Sativa dominant hybrid the team at SoCal Seed Co. decided to take the famous Indica heavy, Chem 4 and cross it with the massive and resinous Asian classic, Chocolate Thai.

It is a cross between the famed Chemdawg\u00a0D and Tang Tang, a hybrid created by Grindhouse Medical Seeds. Mob Boss tends to lean sativa, with a somewhat cerebral high, but different phenotypes of this strain may offer users different effects. Mob Boss\u2019 THC content ranges from 15% to 20%. Mob Boss is marked by small to medium buds that have a somewhat tapered, conical shape. The buds are very dense when properly cured, with the light green leaves tightly coiling in on themselves. Red hairs -- which are actually pistils, intended to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants -- are threaded through the leaves. These already-colorful flowers are covered in trichomes, lending them a silvery and moist-looking sheen. As a result, buds of Mob Boss can be very sticky and difficult to break up without the use of a grinder. The smell of sweet citrus jumps off of these flowers, with herbal notes lurking just underneath. Breaking open or combusting the flowers gives off a more musky odor. The smoke from this strain is harsh and cough-inducing and can sting users\u2019 eyes and sinuses. On the exhale, the overall impression is a mix of sweet and sour flavors that tends to linger on the palate. Mob Boss is known to take hold of users quickly. It begins as a head buzz that is accompanied by an intensification of the senses -- smokers may perceive sounds and colors differently. After adjusting to this altered state, many find that this strain has a strong cerebral character that may work well in situations that call for creative thinking or problem solving. This sensory sharpening can also feel psychedelic -- sensations like visual distortions and time dilation are possible. If enjoying Mob Boss in a relaxed set and setting, some might detect a slight body buzz which, while it may not bring about couchlock, will at least engender some relaxation. As with its recreational uses, the medical applications of Mob Boss can be both mental and physical. Its ability to elevate mood can have considerable benefits for those suffering from stress, depression, anxiety, and even PTSD. Those with attention deficit disorders might also find that Mob Boss allows for increased and sustained concentration. Alternatively, this strain\u2019s palpable indica buzz can be used to treat mild to moderate aches and pains. It can also be a potent appetite stimulant and, in large enough doses, can be used to treat insomnia. A small amount of this strain goes a long way, and those with a lower tolerance for THC should with a low dosage and then adjust consumption accordingly. A few different companies have released packaged seeds of Mob Boss. It can also be grown as a clone if growers are able to obtain clippings from a healthy, mature plant. This strain can be cultivated indoors or out, but outdoor cultivation calls for Mediterranean-like climates with constant humidity and daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Indoors, Mob Boss\u2019 height can be trained to a maximum of about 4 feet, as long as growers train their plants by bending and pruning branches early on in the vegetative stage. Additionally, thanks to a favorable leaf-to-bud ratio, growers may not need to trim these plants as frequently as those of other varieties. Mob Boss typically flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors. Growers can expect yields of 1.3 to 1.6 ounces (or about 37 to 46 grams) of flower per square foot of plant. Growers should also properly cure their harvested buds in order to preserve Mob Boss\u2019 potency and unique taste. The curing process involves first drying the buds by hanging them upside down for about a week in a room that maintains 50% humidity and a consistent temperature of 70 degree Fahrenheit; and then sealing them in wide-mouthed jars in ambient surroundings of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and between 60-65% humidity, checking regularly for mold and mildew. With a bold high that\u2019s as enjoyable out with friends as it is during a lazy solo afternoon, Mob Boss is a uniquely versatile strain.

Created by Amsterdam-based seed company Barney\u2019s Farm, it is a cross between G13 and Haze descendant Neville\u2019s Haze. The strain offers a bold citrus flavor profile as well as a clearheaded, well-balanced high that keeps users both relaxed and alert. This tasty variety won First Place overall in the 2010 Cannabis Cup. It boasts an impressive THC content that hovers around 25%. Flowers of this strain grow large and chunky, with a dense bud structure that\u2019s more typical of indica than sativa varieties. The leaves are forest green, with some phenotypes showing traces of dark purple. This latter color results when pigments called anthocyanins are brought out by colder than average temperatures during the growing process. The flowers are covered in sticky white trichomes that give flowers a dewy look -- and account for this strain\u2019s high THC content. Orange pistils are threaded through these colorful leaves. The intense citrus fragrance is where this strain really lives up to its bag appeal -- the cured flowers give off a scent of orange with some sweet earthiness mixed in. Many fans also describe a spicy, clove-like undertone, further enhancing the orange top notes. Breaking up the sticky buds yields a more herbal funk, likely passed on from Haze genetics. Smoke hits smoothly and has a chemical-like, diesel taste. When exhaled, smoke has the distinct taste of orange zest, along with a slight tanginess that lingers on the palate. Tangerine Dream smokers usually feel an immediate head rush that leaves the senses buzzing. What follows is a spreading feeling of warmth and emotional uplift that can be disorienting in the short term. Thought-provoking and cerebral, but still grounded, this strain offers a high that can be as productive or as lazy as users intend. This balance can tip towards a heavier body high in larger doses, however. Medically, Tangerine Dream has application for mood disorders. It can be a source of relief for those suffering from stress and anxiety. Its functional sense of focus may also be beneficial for users with attention deficit disorders. Some may feel a relaxation of tense muscles and relief from chronic aches and pains. If enough is consumed, Tangerine Dream can also be a sleep-inducing treatment for insomnia. Tangerine Dream can be grown indoors and outdoors, although outdoor growing requires warm and humid climates with consistent sunlight. The short and bushy plants are more characteristic of indica varieties and can easily be cultivated indoors, as they range between 3 and 4 feet tall when fully grown. This strain\u2019s hardy genetics make for thick central stems and supporting branches to hold up the dense buds -- this means that growers may not necessarily need to provide staked supports as plants entering the flowering stage. Flowering happens within 8 to 10 weeks when plants are grown indoors, and flowers are ready for harvest by late October when grown outdoors. Tangerine Dream has a fairly high yield of about 46 to 56 grams (or 1.6 to 2 ounces) per square foot of plant. In order to preserve the characteristic taste of the carefully-grown buds (and to keep smoke as smooth as possible), users should also be sure to cure the flowers. Curing is a two-stage process: First, growers should hang the buds upside down by the stem or lay them on drying racks that provide air circulation for 7 to 10 days; the surrounding humidity should be 50% and the temperature about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Once stems snap off of the flowers relatively easily, growers can then seal the buds in airtight wide-mouthed jars in ambient humidity of 60-65% and temperature around 70 degrees. While they cure in the jars, buds should be checked at least daily for a week to ensure that they haven\u2019t developed mold.

Harlequin is the sativa-dominant product of several different landrace strains: 1970s favorite Colombian Gold, Thai and Swiss sativa landraces, and a Nepali indica variety. These patchwork genetics may account for the strain\u2019s name -- \u201charlequin\u201d originally referred to the brightly-patterned costumes of traditional Italian clowns of the same name. Harlequin is approximately 75% sativa, although it lacks the characteristically strong cerebral sativa high due to the mitigating presence of CBD. The standard ratio of CBD to THC in Harlequin is 5:2. Cannabis lab Analytics 360 has measured samples of this strain at between 4% to 10% THC \u00a0and 6% to 15% CBD. Harlequin has won multiple Cannabis Cup awards for its CBD content in both bud and concentrate form. Harlequin has tight, dense buds of medium size. Its leaves are medium green with pistils that vary in color from orange to vivid red. Despite lower than average concentrations of THC, Harlequin is typically covered in sticky white trichomes. When properly cured, the buds smell musky with traces of tropical fruit underneath. The combusted flowers have a woody, earthy scent and taste of mango and citrus fruits when inhaled. The smooth smoke is not known to induce coughing, and it finishes with a rich, hashy aftertaste. Because\u00a0its THC content is so low, and because its high CBD counteracts the psychoactive effects of that THC, Harlequin is not likely to get the user particularly high. Any mental effects take the form of an uplift in mood, conferring a mellow mindset and allowing for some mild anxiety relief. Some users report an increased sense of focus or a shift in perspective, but just as frequently, they\u2019re able to pull themselves out of this altered state and closer to sobriety. Instead of a potent high, Harlequin is known to offer pain relief from both mild and chronic conditions. It can alleviate the aches associated with joint pain and stiffness. It can also have powerful anti-inflammatory properties, making it beneficial as a medication for fibromyalgia and neuralgic pain. Additionally, Harlequin can relieve moderate nausea. This strain allows for sustained mental focus without a heavy body stone -- this makes it a versatile medicine that can be as easily used during the day or at night. Harlequin is a clone-only strain, meaning that in order to cultivate it, prospective growers need to obtain clippings from a mature plant. These clones are often available at cannabis conventions and expos, or could be obtained from a fellow grower. Although several digital seed companies purport to sell packaged seeds of Harlequin, such claims should be regarded with suspicion, as the strain\u2019s growers claim to have never released seeds. Harlequin can be grown by newcomers or by those with significantly more cultivation experience. Outdoors, plants require a steady source of sunlight and temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. However, growers cultivating outdoors should watch out for environmental threats, as Harlequin is not particularly resistant to pests or to fungus. The strain is easily grown indoors, as its plants have a typically indica shape -- they are squat and bushy, with strong lateral branching. Harlequin has an average yield, although its flowering nodes (or colas) are so dense and large that they may require stakes for support as plants enter the flowering stage. Indoors, plants flower within 9 to 10 weeks; if flowers are harvested after the 10 week period, THC content may increase so that it equals or exceeds the desired CBD content. Also, because its bud structure is so dense and prone to develop mold, Harlequin may require 3 weeks, rather than the typical 10 days, to properly. The spread of medical and recreational cannabis legalization has brought new attention to CBD as an instrument of health. Charlotte\u2019s Web, developed for a young epilepsy patient, has sparked international attention and even drawn families to Colorado, seeking treatment that doesn\u2019t come with a high. And although Harlequin still has a tinge of THC and some associated psychoactivity, it\u2019s still a medically potent strain, suitable for a range of conditions. Its uplifting but functional high allows the user to perform work, errands, and even exercise. Harlequin landrace heritage has given it genetic heartiness and stability, while selective breeding by cannabist botanists has boosted the valuable concentration of THC. Harlequin\u2019s desirable properties have also been used to yield child strain Pennywise, another CBD-heavy (albeit indica-dominant) strain."], "attributes": {"anxiety": 20, "pain": 60, "energetic": 20, "relaxed": 40, "creative": 60, "focused": 40, "appetite": 40, "cotton mouth": 20, "depression": 20, "nausea": 40}}], "turtle power": [{"source": "QANNABIS", "kind": [0, 0, -1], "description": "\\xa0", "attributes": {}}], "hawaiian lights": [{"source": "FOURTWENTY101", "kind": [50, 50, 1], "description": "The Gage Green Group\\'s strain known as, \"Hawaiian Lights\" is a fast growing and highly resinous hybrid variety that has the same super potent effects as her legendary Northern Lights parent.

These strains are so named for smelling just like their namesake cereal. Although most are labeled as a hybrids or as slightly Indica-dominant, the true genetics of Fruity Pebbles may be impossible to discern, as individual growers may use different parent strains or breeding techniques. THC composition of strains labeled Fruity Pebbles have tested anywhere from 15% to 28%. One variety, created by breeders Alien Genetics, was marketed as Fruity Pebbles OG, an April 2012 limited edition. Packs of these special Fruity Pebbles OG seeds sold for $1,000-$1,500 each. The mother, a cross of Green Ribbon and Granddaddy Purps, was bred with a strain crossed from Tahoe OG and Alien Kush. Given that successful growers can reap anywhere from $1,500 to $3,000 per plant, a pack of these specialty seeds may substantially cut into profit margins for commercial growers -- and would certainly be a sunk cost for the more casual home grower. Fruity Pebbles is marked by long and densely-packed conical buds that look strikingly different from the smaller, more compact nugs more typical of pure indicas. Leaves are green, although many phenotypes have vibrant shades of purple and red with contrasting orange pistils. These bright colors -- which provide further reason for this strain\u2019s name -- are the result of anthocyanins, compounds similar to chlorophyll in the plant that produce colors when exposed to cold temperatures. Perhaps most notably, Fruity Pebbles has a sweet, tropical scent, similar to citrus and berries. Breaking the buds open yields a more spicy, hashy scent. When combusted, the smoke from this strain is smooth when drawn through a joint or a pipe and it has a sugary, fruity aftertaste. Most cannabis strains sold under the label Fruity Pebbles provide a hybrid-type high that takes hold quickly, with a soft but strong body buzz that can provide relaxation and some spacey, psychedelic effects. Many fans of the strains describe a strange physical sensation and a sharpening of the senses and a heightened awareness that can lend itself to stimulating conversation, creative projects, or even exercise. However, the more indica-dominant varieties of Fruity Pebbles have the capacity to produce produce heavy body highs that cause couchlock. \u00a0In general, these strains may be effective medication for pain, mood disorders, migraines, and attention deficit disorders. Indica-leaning phenotypes are also very helpful in relieving insomnia, and easing mental tension. Those looking to grow their own supply of Fruity Pebbles can obtain clones (healthy clippings) from mature plants. Alternatively, it\u2019s possible to buy packaged seeds of Fruity Pebbles. Growing outdoors requires a steady temperate climate with indirect sunlight. Those looking to grow indoors should plan on having a large gros space -- depending on the phenotype, Fruity Pebbles can grow to tall sativa-like heights with a heavy yield of flowers that will need to be staked and tied to grow properly. Growers should be sure to trim fan leaves at the tops of plants in order to let light penetrate to lower branches. Indoors, plants will flower and be ready for harvest within 8 to 9 weeks. Because the flowers have a pungent, fruity odor, growers may want to equip their growing spaces with tools like carbon filters or exhaust fans. Fruity Pebbles are considered a somewhat difficult strain to grow, and may pose a challenge for the novice grower. Although its appearance and tropical taste may classify it as a novelty craft strain, Fruity Pebbles can be a potent standby option. Whether a hybrid that stimulates thought and creativity or an indica suited to solo evening use, this strain has a nuanced high to match its impressive taste profile. Fruity Pebbles works well in social settings -- its distinctive smell is sure to turn heads and attract some new friends, as long as you don\u2019t mind sharing."], "attributes": {"anxiety": 60, "pain": 100, "relaxed": 40, "euphoric": 100, "creative": 60, "appetite": 20, "dry eyes": 20, "cotton mouth": 20, "depression": 60, "nausea": 40}}], "hitman og": [{"source": "FOURTWENTY101", "kind": [100, 0, 1], "description": "DNA Genetics recently released, Hitman OG is a super dank Indica dominant hybrid that was only made in limited numbers and will quickly become a rare item to track down.

Romulan, Deathstar, Skywalker, and Alien Kush have all become popular varieties -- and even if they don\u2019t give you a new appreciation of the genre, will at least make you feel like an extraterrestrial being yourself. Now, indica-heavy hybrid Dr. Who will allow you to experience a special sort of time-travel. Named after the long-running BBC sci-fi series, Dr. Who is a potent cross between dynamic sativa Timewreck and flavorful indica Mad Scientist. It was created by Pacific Northwest-based breeders Homegrown Natural. This is a particularly potent strain, with a THC content that ranges from 20% to a whopping 30%. Dr. Who typically has small to medium-sized buds that hold a dense and heavy structure, typical of indicas. It is distinguished by earthy green leaves that are shot through with a vibrant shade of purple. Almost all phenotypes of Dr. Who show these purple hues, which are the result of high concentrations of anthocyanin pigments stimulated by unusually cold weather during the growing process. Trichomes dust the surfaces of the flowers and are also visible on the insides of buds if they\u2019re broken open -- in all, Dr. Who is very sticky when properly cured. The primary smell of this strain is dank and reminiscent of wet earth. There are also some traces of sour lemon and other tropical fruits lingering underneath. When combusted, the flowers have a harsh smoke which can induce heavy coughing and can sting the sinuses. On the exhale, this smoke has a notably sweet and tangy taste. Interestingly, not all phenotypes of Dr. Who will smell or taste like grape, as the pigments that dictate this strain\u2019s color do not have an effect on its flavor. Dr. Who has a high that mounts slowly and is eventually made obvious by a heaviness in the head. Users will also detect a sharpening of the senses -- sounds, smells, colors, and even tastes may seem more dynamic and intense. Appropriately enough for a strain named after a time-hopping humanoid, Dr. Who may also confer a strong sense of time dilation. Any changes in perception are more relaxing than energizing, in synch with Dr. Who\u2019s mellow body buzz. As the high progresses, this relaxing stimulation of both body and mind can take any direction the user prefers -- it\u2019s a great choice for embracing creativity, taking a long walk, or just having a rambling conversation with friends. Medically, Dr. Who has mostly physical applications. It\u2019s a great way to melt away mild aches; it can even dull pain associated with serious diseases like fibromyalgia or multiple sclerosis. When consumed in large enough amounts, it can also be an effective treatment for insomnia. Side effects include dry mouth and heavy, droopy eyes -- although couchlock isn\u2019t often reported, and this strain\u2019s mellow character means that there\u2019s a low risk of paranoia. Dr. Who\u2019s high THC content makes it a potent strain for novices and experienced cannabis users alike. Dr. Who can be grown from commercially-available seed. It can be successfully cultivated indoors or out. Outdoors, it has the advantage of being resistant to mildew, but requires consistent daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It flourishes indoors, where growing conditions can be more easily controlled. Characteristic of indica varieties, plants of Dr. Who tend to be short and bushy with wide lateral branches. When mature, it sports large buds which may require supports like stakes or dowels to keep them from drooping on their branches. In order to bring out this strain\u2019s eye-catching purple and blue colors, growers should \u201cshock\u201d plants by exposing them to cold late in the vegetative stage. Dr. Who flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors. Dr. Who\u2019s balanced high and unique fruity-hashy taste make it a quality cross between two distinctive varieties. Its relaxing but clearheaded high can be a great addition to either social or solo settings. Its very high trichome production also makes it a great strain for producing hash and other THC concentrates.

This hybrid is cheekily named for its famed mother strain Cinderella \u201899, a Jack Herer\u00a0- descended sativa created by Colorado-based breeders Brothers Grimm. Glass Slipper\u2019s father strain is unknown -- there is some conjecture as to whether the mystery parent is The White, LA Confidential, or even a Pineapple phenotype. What\u2019s certain, though, is Glass Slipper\u2019s potency -- with a THC composition between 20% and 25%, it\u2019s just as conceivable that this strain is named for its glassy coating of trichomes. Glass Slipper has small to medium-sized buds that take a popcorn-like shape when cured. The dried flowers curl up into a dense, indica-typical structure. This strain\u2019s leaves are unremarkable, appearing green to deep yellow. They are coated in sticky, milky-white trichomes, making this a difficult strain to break up by hand. Whatever Glass Slipper\u2019s flowers lack in appearance, however, they make up for in dynamic aroma. The smell is strikingly sweet and fruity, with particularly tropical notes. A little bit of dank earthiness exists underneath this candy-like profile, reminiscent of Cinderella \u201899 herself. When combusted, Glass Slipper burns smooth and delivers an easy toke with a buttery consistency. This strain\u2019s aftertaste has a leathery, musky quality, and a Kush-like odor hangs in the air long after smokers have finished. The high from Glass Slipper sets in very quickly, seizing users with a boost of energy and an uplift in mood. In the right set and setting, many describe a soaring euphoria even before they begin to \u201cpeak.\u201d As the high progresses, many will discern that this strain has a mild body stone, but nothing that will threaten to immobilize. Glass Slipper\u2019s sativa intensity may enhance the senses, making experiences like watching TV, listening to music, and even eating food noticeably more intense. Its mental stimulation and encouragement of free associative thinking also make this a great social lubricant, helping the introverted to feel more chatty. This strain\u2019s combination of relaxation and emotional contentment mark it as an enjoyable daytime or early evening treat. Its subtle but grounding body buzz also mellows out its cerebral qualities; users prone to anxiety will not need to worry about jittery paranoia that can come with other strong sativas. Although it may not be the best treatment for chronic physical pain, Glass Slipper does have medical application for some psychological conditions. The surging sense of emotional well-being can be a great way to temporarily relieve the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and even PTSD in some cases. Its clearheaded cerebral nature also makes this strain a great way for those with attention deficit disorders to maintain focus. Glass Slipper can even be a popular appetite stimulant -- which, depending on an individual user\u2019s priorities, may either be either a help or a hindrance. Retailer Dutch Riot sells packaged seeds of a Glass Slipper variety that crosses Cinderella \u201899 with Pineapple \u201899; any other Glass Slipper varieties may need to be cultivated as clones, from clippings of existing plants. This can be a novice-friendly strain to grow. Outdoors, it requires consistently warm and Mediterranean-like conditions, although, as with Cinderella \u201899, the plants can prove resistant to disease. In controlled indoor conditions, the medium-height plants can be trained to fit within their grow space as long as growers prune and bend branches early on in the vegetative stage. Growers should also \u201ctop\u201d plants of Glass Slipper by trimming any light-blocking fan leaves in order to encourage growth on low-lying branches. This strain flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and offers moderate to high yields; after all, parent strain Cinderella can yield as much as 84 grams -- or 3 ounces -- of flowers per square foot of plant. Although it\u2019s relatively hard to come by, Glass Slipper is universally praised for its taste and comfortably cerebral high. Its creative flow makes it equally enjoyable alone or in lively group settings.

As mentioned above, this strain should be relegated to evening or night time use. It is highly prescribed to people fighting sleep deprivation and insomnia. Banana Kush is often sought out by patients suffering from chronic aches and pains. Others use it for relief from stress and anxiety. To a lesser degree, it may help patients suffering from migraines, glaucoma, nausea, eating disorders and muscle spasms. Banana Kush is bred by Cali Kush. It is a cross between the widely known OG Kush mother and a Banana father. The result is a delicious strain that is 60% Indica with an 18-20% THC concentration. It is not recommended for amateur growers because it can require a great deal of attention. Banana Kush can be grown indoors or out.

Composed from a cross of staple strain Haze and several different worldwide landraces, including Thai, Hawaiian, and Afghani, Amnesia Haze may actually drive inspiration rather than forgetfulness. The Afghani indica in its genetics makes for a well-balanced, albeit somewhat cerebral high. Amnesia Haze that exists in the commercial market is mainly derived from two sources: First Medical Seed and Soma Seeds, the Amsterdam-based company responsible for creative strains like Lavender. The strain is a favorite for its uplifting vibes and its rich flavor. It won 1st place overall in the 2004 Cannabis Cup and Best Sativa in the 2012 Cannabis Cup. The THC content of Amnesia Haze ranges from about 20% to 25%. This strain is distinguished by its chunky, dense flowers which show a synthesis of indica and sativa bud structures: although tightly-packed, the buds are more tapered and comical than round. Depending on how they're cured, buds will have a greenish to yellow tint. Rust-colored pistils, meant for the flowers to catch pollen from other male cannabis plants, stand out against the leaves. Phenotypes of Amnesia Haze can vary, with some playing host to more cloudy white trichomes than others; psychoactive potency can also vary in these cases. The unique size of the strain\u2019s buds is matched by a unique scent and taste. The flowers immediately present a lemony tang that is mellowed out by some earthiness. Notes of wood, especially cedar, are evident in the buds. Breaking open the buds gives off a faint spicy scent, which may be familiar to fans of other strains in the Haze family. Despite all this richness, smoke is smooth when inhaled. The taste, both immediately and when exhaled, is again typical of Haze strains, with a spicy and citrus-infected flavor. This can be a pungent strain, and the smell of smoke may linger. Amnesia Haze has many of the great qualities that mark both indica and sativa varieties, although users may land on the more thoughtful (or even hyper-thoughthful) end of that spectrum. The high comes up almost immediately, inducing cerebral thinking and a sudden acute awareness of surroundings. In a positive set and setting, this mental sharpening can lead to a euphoric state of mind. Users may feel an improvement in mood as well as an energy to accomplish tasks. Although cerebral, Amnesia Haze also has enough of an indica backbone to also provide relaxation and contemplativeness. The combination of strong mental and physical effects makes this strain a good choice for activities that involve both mind and body, including but not limited to exercise and sex. More medically speaking, Amnesia Haze\u2019s sense of focus can be helpful for those with attention deficit disorders who have trouble concentrating on specific tasks. It can also be a strong appetite stimulant. On the negative side, those prone to anxiety may experience some degree of paranoia due to Amnesia Haze\u2019s tendency to bring on a sense of frantic mind-race; as such, cannabis newcomers may want to temper initial dosage of this strain. This variety\u2019s strong high also tends to last longer than average. Grown outdoors, Amnesia Haze requires a predominantly hot climate with consistent temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It can easily be grown indoors, however, as plants are more typical of indica varieties -- limbs reach more horizontally than vertically, with a bushy stature that doesn\u2019t usually exceed more than 3 or 4 feet. Growers should trim broad fan leaves at the top of the plant in order to let air and light reach flowering nodes on the lower branches. Amnesia Haze takes an extremely long time to mature: plants flower within 10 to 12 weeks, making this a tough strain for commercial growers to cultivate for profit. As such, it may be difficult to find in the cannabis retail market. Personal growers can raise Amnesia Haze plants from seed or from clippings taken to produce clones. The very long flowering time rewards growers with trichomes and with 60 grams or 2 ounces per square foot of plant. Despite its relative rarity, Amnesia Haze is a popular strain in areas where cannabis is openly cultivated. Its even, well-balanced high is versatile for both mellow and more boisterous use. In particular, it can leave users chatty, making it a good addition to social situations. Alternatively, Amnesia Haze is a good choice for focusing on work in an isolated setting. Its energizing high is more likely to leave you wired than sleepy, so smoking shortly before bedtime is not recommended. Instead, Amnesia Haze\u2019s high and comforting earthy taste is just the thing for spending a cold day indoors."], "attributes": {"anxiety": 80, "pain": 60, "energetic": 60, "euphoric": 100, "creative": 40, "focused": 60, "paranoia": 60, "appetite": 40, "depression": 100, "nausea": 40}}], "first lady": [{"source": "FOURTWENTY101", "kind": [100, 0, 1], "description": "The Sensi Seed\\'s strain known as, \"First Lady\" is a nearly pure Indica heavy hybrid that produces solid amounts of extremely resinous flowers in a ridiculously short amount of time.

It can also be an excellent sedative when consumed in larger quantities. Produced by breeders Sannie\u2019s Seeds, it is a cross between the notorious White Widow and Herijuana, a hybrid derived from Afghani\u00a0landrace genetics. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found flowers of Mad Scientist to have an average THC content of 15% -- although Sannie\u2019s claims THC levels can reach as high as 24%. Mad Scientist has strikingly large, spherical flowers composed of tightly curled leaves and pistils. The dense, indica-typical buds are hard and solid. Leaves themselves are a mossy green and contrast with a high concentration of bright orange, pollen-catching pistils. Parent strain White Widow passes on a tendency for high resin production, giving these buds a thick coating of silvery trichomes. When properly cured, flowers of Mad Scientist have the heady aroma of citrus and musk. Some acrid skunkiness is present as a base note, likely the influence of Afghani indica roots. When combusted, this strain can have a harsh, eye-stinging smoke that leaves behind the taste of pine and lemon when exhaled. This hybrid\u2019s high creeps up, often taking effect well after smokers have finished savoring its unique taste. Effects begin in the mind, with a notably altered perception of setting; sounds and visuals may appear sharper or more intense. Thoughts may begin to race -- but this strain won\u2019t turn you into an actual mad scientist. Instead, as users adjust to the high, they may experience their surroundings as psychedelic or surreal. Mad Scientist also has some palpable physical effects. As the high progresses, relaxation spreads down from the shoulders and through the core, killing tension and facilitating deep, cleansing breathing. The combination of effects on mind and body makes this a great choice for an afternoon stroll, a creative project, or simply a lazy lounge session. Perhaps unsurprisingly because of its THC content, this can be a potent strain even for more experienced cannabis smokers. Mad Scientist can also be beneficial for medical cannabis patients. Its relaxing physical properties can provide relief from aches and pains -- both incidental, due to injury, or chronic, due to conditions like fibromyalgia or lupus. It can ease headaches and, in large enough doses, can lull insomnia patients into a restful sleep. This strain\u2019s uplifting sativa side can help boost the moods of those struggling against stress or depression. Its feeling of lucid focus can also aid users with attention deficit disorders. Because of the uptick in cerebral activity in early stages of the high, Mad Scientist may not be the best choice for those prone to paranoia or anxiety. Producers Sannie\u2019s Seeds have made seeds of Mad Scientist available for commercial retail. Prospective growers can also take clippings of mature plants of this strain in order to grow genetic clones. Mad Scientist can be grown indoors or out. Outdoor cultivation requires Mediterranean-like climates with consistent daytime temperatures in the 72 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. It has short and bushy plants, characteristic of other indica varieties, that can easily fit in indoor grow spaces. This plant should also be trimmed of any high-growing fan leaves that could block air and light from reaching the lower flowering nodes. Mad Scientist flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors. It offers a solid yield of about 51 grams (or 1.8 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant. Curing the buds -- by first hanging them up to dry and then sealing them in airtight containers with moderate humidity -- can help preserve their sticky trichomes and kushy citrus flavor. Versatile enough for use at any time of day, Mad Scientist is well-rounded enough to gain a substantial following among fans of hybrids.

Professor Chaos provides smokers with the energy and creative thinking needed to accomplish anything from errands to more complicated work. Its THC content ranges from 20% to 25%.

The tapered, medium-sized buds have a fluffy, sativa-like texture and the leaves tear away easily from the central stem. Leaves themselves are a light green, offset by pistils that range in color from yellow to deep orange. The chunky buds are dusted by icy trichomes, making this strain slightly sticky to the touch. When properly cured, the flowers smell strongly of tangy, sour citrus. Grinding or breaking open the buds gives off a more piney odor. Although Professor Chaos\u2019 taste isn\u2019t especially memorable, users may detect a spiciness when exhaling. This is a very pungent strain -- its funk can linger for a while after users have finished smoking. Professor Chaos has a high that hits the smoker relatively quickly. Users may feel an increased pressure around the eyes and temples and a heightened sense of awareness. If not overly disoriented, they may then detect a change in thinking that can jump from one subject to the next in a freely associative way. If consumed in moderation, this cerebral strain can aid tasks that require problem-solving skills and creative thinking. Meanwhile, a slight body high confers relaxation and may mellow out any edge brought by the more cerebral effects. Professor Chaos has medical applications that mirror its recreational uses. Its soaring euphoric effects can temporarily improve move for those afflicted with stress and depression. If pointed in the right direction, its sense of focus can also help those with attention deficit disorders to work on a single task.

Prospective growers may also be lucky enough to obtain clippings of this comparatively rare strain to grow as genetically identical \u201cclones.\u201d Professor Chaos can be cultivated indoors or outdoors, although outdoor growing calls for semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climates with daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. If grown indoors, this medium-height plant should be trained to fit into its grow space through the pruning and bending of branches early in the vegetative stage. Professor Chaos flowers within 8 to 9 weeks -- a relatively short period of time for a sativa. Growers should also be warned that this is a very pungent strain, during both vegetative and flowering stages. Those looking to keep their operations discreet should invest in odor control measures like carbon air filter and exhaust fans. With a rollicking high that stimulates thought but also entails physical relaxation, Professor Chaos is a great choice for a range of situations.

The genetics of Super Lemon Haze combine\u00a0sweet and tart, lemony tastes and aromas\u00a0that make for a mellow high that begins in the body but quickly flows to the mind. The THC count of this strain can reach as high as 25 percent, which can lead to paranoia and anxiety when consumed in larger quantities by novice smokers.

The mood elevating properties of Super Lemon Haze may also help regulate mood disorders, such as chronic depression, PTSD and/or anxiety. This strain may help patients dealing with minor pains, nausea and appetite loss. It may also help patients over come ADD/ADHD and migraines. Not the best choice for an amateur's first grow, Super Lemon Haze is a strain that does not require a lot of attention, though it may need support during flowering. That period of growth can last between 56 and 65 days, which makes plants ready for harvest in October or November outside. Super Lemon Haze is well suited for the Screen of Green technique.

A sativa-dominant hybrid developed by Sensi Seeds in the 1980s or 90s, it is a tasty and perennially popular strain. Jack Herer has passed its genetics and part of its name on to crossbred strains like Jack the Ripper, Jack\u2019s Cleaner, and Jack Skellington. Although the exact genetic formula is a guarded secret, Jack Herer is thought to be the product of sativa staple Haze and a cross of Northern Lights #5 and Shiva Skunk. Sticky buds have an appealing orange-lemon scent and taste with just a hint of some dank pine. The high provides an excellent balance between cerebral and physical effects, leaving users deeply relaxed but attentive and conversant. Jack Herer\u2019s appealing flavor and well-rounded effects has made it hugely popular with medical and recreational cannabis users alike; it has won nine Cannabis Cup titles. Cannabis lab Analytical 360 has measured Jack Herer flowers as having between 15% and 24% THC. Jack Herer\u2019s flowers are not particularly visually impressive: pale to medium green leaves form in densely-packed buds that are more elongated that rounded. The trichome count is high, making this a very sticky plant to handle. What Jack Herer lacks in visual appeal, though, it makes up for in scent. Cured properly, the flowers have a deep floral bouquet with hints of orange and lemon zest. Breaking open the dense buds shows off more of the citrus scent along with a peppery kick. When burnt, the flowers give off a surprisingly clean and herbal scent, similar to sage. The very smooth and easy smoke tastes similarly herbal. Although not overwhelmingly pungent, Jack Herer leaves behind a lingering spicy-floral odor giving the general impression of potpourri. This strain acts quickly -- users are hit with a strong headrush that is noticeably more energizing than disorienting. As time progresses, or greater doses are consumed, this initial tingle spreads down the neck and through the limbs, creating a sense of relaxation without immobilizing. What follows is an alert and easily suggestible high marked by creativity. This is a particularly good strain for creative brainstorming and visualization. The sense of ease and creativity also makes Jack Herer great for facilitating conversation in social settings. Because it provides dual relaxation and buzz for the mind and body, Jack Herer typically leaves users feeling stimulated but in full lucid control of their actions. This mellow high is good for treating low-grade stress, anxiety, and depression. Users have also described relief from migraines. Although not high in CBD, Jack Herer can also be beneficial for chronic aches and pains. It is not recommended for those suffering from insomnia, as the stimulation of thought and mood can actually keep users awake. More of a daytime treat than an evening medication, Jack Herer could be considered an ideal \u201cwake and bake\u201d strain. Seeds of Jack Herer are available from the strain\u2019s creator Sensi; alternatively, prospective growers can obtain mature clippings from healthy plants in order to grow clones. Sensi describes four distinct phenotypes of Jack Herer: two that lean indica and two that are predominantly sativa. Outdoor growers should plant in Mediterranean-like climates that maintain daily temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Because plants can reach heights of 8 feet in certain conditions, indoor growers should be sure to curb the height of Jack Herer by topping and by flowering soon after the plants take root. Jack Herer typically has a lower than average yield. It flowers within a comparatively long 10 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in mid to late October. Jack Herer\u2019s well-rounded high makes it a great strain for cannabis newcomers. It\u2019s uniquely social in its ability to facilitate conversation while allowing users to maintain a semblance of awareness.

Its parent, Skunk #1, is a reliable and legendary strain that first created Shiva Skunk. Three years later came Super Skunk, which the breeder, Sensei Seeds, calls the first hybrid breeding project with Afghani roots. The breeder says that Super Skunk adds potency, weight, and flavor to Skunk #1 and Shiva Skunk.\u00a0 The company continues its experiments in Afghan hybrids, as do other companies in the U.S. and abroad. Breeders are chasing the dream of a perfect Afghani genotype that matches Skunk #1. Their passion stems from Skunk #1\u2019s global influence since\u00a0the 1970s and it's crosses that span generations including Acapulco Gold and Colombian Gold. Super Skunk inherits its parent\u2019s aromatic values, which people call skunk due to its overwhelming resemblance to the black and white woodland creature. Others say that the smell is like cheese or the fungus underside of a rock. People describe the smoke as clean and the taste as sweet. Super Skunk is green in color, but some people have noticed undertones of orange and brown. Buds are dense with short trichromes, the hair, outgrowths, or appendages on the plant. Some say the skunky smell reminds them of ammonia while others say Super Skunk has fruity notes of pomegranate and cranberry. The pleasant effects are short-acting to medium-acting, for about 90 minutes. The heavy, Indica-style body buzz is good for medical users. You can use it all times of day for pain relief. Use it at night to calm anxiety and alleviate insomnia. People with headaches and cramps also use the relaxing cannabis strain.\u00a0 For recreational users, the strain with the distinctive smell of skunk is something to get excited about as it may put you into a spacey state or a euphoric zone. People with all tolerance levels should find something to like in the strain.\u00a0 The THC level is above normal at 19 percent and at 2.4 percent, the CBD level is high, making it suitable for the more serious medical conditions such as seizures. People with trouble eating, such as those with chemotherapy-induced nausea, may like this strain as it is known to boost the appetite. Super Skunk has not changed much since the early 1990's when it was originally released and it has a reputation for being very strong and potent. Super Skunk has dense, thick buds and is not difficult to grow.\u00a0 When growing indoors one can expect higher than average yields at\u00a0roughly 15\u00a0ounces per square meter and a flowering time between 8\u00a0and 9 weeks.

Contrary to its depiction in film as a government-created experimental drug with military applications, Pineapple Express is a cross between landrace sativa Hawaiian and hybrid Trainwreck, which is itself a cross between far-flung landraces from Mexico, Thailand, and Afghanistan. Although there\u2019s no consensus on whether or not the Pineapple Express strain lent the 2008 movie its name or vice versa, there\u2019s no doubting the appeal of this well-balanced hybrid. Its THC content can clock in anywhere between 15% and a staggering 26%; certain phenotypes also contain small amounts of the pain-relieving cannabinoid CBD. Pineapple Express has thick and lumpy buds that show off the strain\u2019s hybridized genetics: they are densely packed like indica flowers, but have the long and tapered shape characteristic of many sativa varieties. The deep green leaves are sometimes tinged with shades of red (the result of pigments activated by cold weather during the grow process) and are accented by deep orange to red pistils. This is a very resinous strain, and the sticky flowers can be very hard to break up without a grinder; the residue left behind may be difficult to clean off of surface and fingertips. The predominant smell of Pineapple Express flowers is, unsurprisingly, pineapple -- but there are other, less tropical scents present like a hint of musk and some dank earthiness. When inhaled, the smooth smoke from this strain tastes earthy and a little bit piney. On the exhale, users will detect a sugary sweetness that lingers in the mouth, although not unpleasantly. Pineapple Express offers what can be described as a creeper of a high -- smokers may have long since finished savoring the smoke\u2019s unique taste before they notice the effects. They begin in the head, with a change in perception. Many have reported some initial psychedelic distortions like a sharpened focus on colors and sounds. As such, Pineapple Express can be a great strain to accompany a scenic walk. This alert head high is soon accompanied by a tingling relaxation in the extremities that helps users feel at ease, whatever their surroundings. The combination of cerebral focus and mellow relaxation makes Pineapple Express a versatile strain, good for chatty get-togethers or getting through a to-do list. Medically, this strain\u2019s feeling of mental calm can be very effective in treating mood and anxiety disorders, helping patients to be more fully present and energetic. And although this strain isn\u2019t as good as some more indica-dominant hybrids in treating physical pain, its head high can actually be useful in distraction users from the acute perception of chronic pain. The high from Pineapple Express is said to last longer than usual, providing a more economically efficient high for many consumers. Pineapple Express can be cultivated from clone clippings, but due to its wide name recognition, many companies have made packaged seeds available online. Depending on phenotypes, plants can be relatively short and bushy or slightly taller and spindly, making them as easily grown indoors as out. Success outdoor cultivation requires a climate as close to tropical as possible, with consistently warm and semi-humid conditions. Pineapple Express plants are ready for harvest in mid to late October when grown outdoors and within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors. This strain has a moderate yield -- growers can expect about 37 grams (or 1.3 ounces) per square foot of plant. This is also an especially pungent strain in both the vegetative and flowering stages, so growers concerned with maintaining discretion should put odor control measures in place, like ionized and carbon air filters or exhaust fans. Although Pineapple Express may not be as overpowering as the eponymous movie implies -- it won\u2019t turn you into a rambling, beat-boxing Bill Hader -- it\u2019s an excellent middle-of-the-road strain for daytime or nighttime use. With its pleasant fruity smell and its upbeat, chatty vibe -- to \u00a0say nothing of its Hollywood credentials -- Pineapple Express is an especially good strain in lively social settings, where it can attract some friendly attention and serve as a great ice-breaker."], "attributes": {"anxiety": 100, "pain": 60, "energetic": 60, "euphoric": 60, "creative": 100, "paranoia": 80, "appetite": 80, "dizziness": 40, "depression": 80, "nausea": 40}}], "818 headband": [{"source": "FOURTWENTY101", "kind": [0, 100, 1], "description": "The Southern California bred, 818 Headband or Sour OG is a super dank Sativa dominant hybrid that was created by the world renowned Cali Connection Seed's.

It originated on the West Coast as a cross between strong sativa Durban Poison and staple hybrid OG Kush. Although it\u2019s a fairly even meld of its two potent parent strains, Girl Scout Cookies has a mellow high that leans more indica. Overall, it\u2019s a versatile and balanced smoke with a THC content that ranges from 18% to 23% but has been tested as high as 28%. Girl Scout Cookies tends to have larger buds that are chunky and densely-packed. The tightly-curled leaves are a bright spring green, and some phenotypes carry streaks of purple. In any cannabis strain, purple hues are evidence of anthocyanin pigments in the plant\u2019s genetics that have been activated by cold temperatures during the vegetative stage. The colorful flowers are also marked by twisted orange pistils. With a very high resin content, buds are covered in white trichomes. They\u2019re also very sticky and can be difficult to break up by hand. Girl Scout Cookies proves its bag appeal with a rich, complex scent -- immediately obvious is a citrus sweetness, undercut by a baseline of earthy musk. When burnt or broken open, however, the buds give off a more toasty, biscuity scent, perhaps explaining the origin of the strain\u2019s name. Smoke tends to be very smooth on the inhale and on the exhale tastes sweet and vaguely herbal. Girl Scout Cookies comes on full-force: feelings of sudden giddiness are common, which can escalate into full-on euphoria. Users may feel increasingly chatty or disposed to socializing. There's also a trippy, psychedelic component to the high. Smokers may notice an enhanced sense of hearing -- or even of taste, with foods taking on a more dynamic flavor. A strong perception of time slowing down is also a commonly reported effect. Some relaxing physicality accompanies this head high; users may feel slightly heavier or more calm. And while Girl Scout Cookies won\u2019t pin you down into an intractable state of couchlock, you may have more difficulty with tasks that require fine motor skills. This combination of easy-going effects on the mind and body means that Girl Scout Cookies has a wide range of medical applications. Its ability to elevate mood can make it valuable to patients suffering from depression, while its sustained sense of focus and immediacy can help those who find themselves keyed-up by stress or anxiety. The strain\u2019s thorough indica relaxation may also relieve patient\u2019s aches and pains, whether incidental or chronic. Potent even for more experienced cannabis fans, Girl Scout Cookies\u2019 balanced high often lasts longer than average. Girl Scout Cookies can be grown from packaged seed or from \u201cclone clippings\u201d taken from mature plants. Once the means are obtained, this strain could be considered a convenient crop for growers of all experience levels. Grown outdoors, the plants require consistently warm and humid daytime surroundings -- although the strain\u2019s hardy genetics make it more resistant to adverse fluctuations in temperature. It can also be easily grown indoors, as the short and bushy plants take well to the \u201csea of green\u201d technique. The thick and compact flowers may need external support from stakes in order to keep from drooping on their overburned branches. The plants flower typically within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors. Growers of Girl Scout Cookies can expect an average yield of about 2 ounces (or 56 grams) per plant. After the painstaking process of cultivation, growers should also be sure to properly cure their mature buds -- curing involves first drying the buds by hanging them upside down for about a week in a room that maintains 50% humidity and a consistent temperature of 70 degree Fahrenheit; and then sealing the dried buds in wide-mouthed jars in an that maintains temperatures of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and between 60-65% humidity.

The aftertaste is tangy and citrusy, but without the ammonia or diesel taste that comes with other lemon-inflected strains. D-Limonene is the chemical compound -- or terpene -- responsible for the lemony scent and taste of Lemon Kush. D-limonene occurs naturally in citrus fruits and is used industrially to enhance the fragrance of lotions and perfumes. This terpene may also have some tangible medical benefits -- in animals and test tube trials, d-limonene was found to have anti-inflammatory and even cancer-fighting properties (although these results were not replicated in a later test among women with breast cancer). D-limonene may also help to relieve acid reflux. The high from Lemon Kush can creep up slowly, taking as long as 5 to 10 minutes before its effects are fully appreciated. An enhanced sense of cerebral focus is characteristic of this high. An increase in creativity and rapid free-association of thoughts is also common, making this a good strain for artistic endeavors or for simply appreciating music or a movie. These mental effects are more clearheaded than spacey, freeing the user up to go about errands or household chores like cleaning. An evenly balanced strain, Lemon Kush also has a bit of a body buzz, mellowing out the cerebral effects and reducing the likelihood of cannabis-induced anxiety or paranoia. Couchlock is not often reported, making Lemon Kush a strain that can be easily enjoyed during the daytime as well as at night. Physically, Lemon Kush has been said to provide relief from headaches and anxiety. Less desirable effects include the annoying feeling of cottonmouth. Lemon Kush can be grown by newcomers to cannabis cultivation, although an indoor environment is recommended. Outdoors, plants will thrive in a warm, almost Mediterranean climate, but may have trouble in regions without consistent warmth and sunlight. Under high-watt bulbs indoors, plants grow between 4 and 6 feet tall and have a standard, bushy indica shape. Plants should be grown in organic soil and supplemented by nutrient treatments like humic acid, vitamin B, and various enzymes. Lemon Kush plants flower indoors at the 8 to 10 week mark; they are ready for harvest between late September and mid October when grown outdoors. Plants provide an average yield. Despite the ambiguity around its origins, Lemon Kush is a tasty and effective strain for those who want to appreciate the ideal effects of both indica and sativa varieties. Its cerebral focus and free-flowing creativity can be mood-altering as well as energizing and motivational. Its body stone allows for deep relaxation without the inconvenience of couchlock or apathy. Because of its unique citrus and peppery taste, Lemon Kush is also a good strain to share in social settings -- it makes for a special treat or a conversation starter."], "attributes": {"pain": 60, "insomnia": 40, "sleepy": 40, "euphoric": 80, "creative": 60, "paranoia": 80, "appetite": 40, "cotton mouth": 40, "depression": 100, "nausea": 40}}], "california karma": [{"source": "FOURTWENTY101", "kind": [100, 0, 1], "description": "SoCal Seed Co.'s, California Karma is a highly medicinal Indica dominant hybrid that has a rather interesting story behind it's genetics.

Although this strain\u2019s origins and creators are something of a mystery, we do know that it\u2019s a cross between pungent staple Sour Diesel and Pure Kush (which is a distinct phenotype of OG Kush, not to be confused with OG Kush itself). This strain offers a multi-faceted high, with an initial cerebral kick that soon mellows into full body relaxation. Flowers of Apple Kush have tested at between 15% and 20% THC content. Apple Kush is marked by medium-sized flowers that are long and almost cylindrical in shape. Cured properly, the buds have a dense, compact structure, with the leaves tightly compressed together. Leaves themselves are a bright green with hints of yellow. The hairy pistils, which appear when in the plant\u2019s early growth stages, stand out against the green buds in hues of orange and brown. A thick coating of trichomes, on the surfaces and inner crevices of the flowers, make this strain difficult to break up without the use of a grinder. While the flowers have a certain clean, fruity smell that reminds some users of apples, there are also prominent floral notes. Grinding or breaking up the buds offers a more sour tang, reminiscent of Cheese. When combusted, Apple Kush has an acrid odor and a harsh smoke that might induce coughing and cause eyes to water. On the exhale, this strain rounds out its fruitiness with a spicy musk that betrays its OG Kush roots. Unlike some hybrids that may blend the psychoactivity of indica and sativa into one balanced, seamless experience, Apple Kush seems to instead affect users in two different stages. The high starts as a quick headrush -- smokers may feel greater blood pressure around their eyes and temples. This physical effect is met with a sudden alertness that may cause users may feel increasingly thoughtful or talkative. As the high wears on though, cerebral stimulation decreases, easing users into an extreme relaxation that can be felt deep in the muscles. Breathing may slow down as tension evaporates. This soothing indica phase of the high comes with a more dreamy mindset is best enjoyed in comfortable, familiar settings. In high enough doses, couchlock can be expected. As such, Apple Kush should be savored during the nighttime or early evening rather than morning or afternoon. Apple Kush\u2019s sedative effects are of value to medical cannabis patients as well. This strain can ease aches and pains, whether, incidental, age-related, or caused by chronic conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia. Apple Kush is also known to soothe headaches and stomach problems. Its tendency to bring about relaxation and sleep also makes it an effective treatment for stress and anxiety-related conditions and insomnia. This relatively uncommon strain doesn\u2019t have the name recognition of its illustrious parents just yet. Seeds of Apple Kush are not available for purchase, meaning that prospective growers need to find existing plants of the strain to take cuttin that can be grown as \u201cclones.\u201d As with many other hybrids, Apple Kush can be successfully cultivated indoors or outdoors, although outdoor grow setups require warm, semi-humid climates with consistent daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Both the Sour Diesel and Pure Kush parent strains have a long flowering period, so anyone lucky enough to obtain clones of Apple Kush should plan on the plants flowering within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and in late October or early November when grown outdoors. Growers should also preserve Apple Kush\u2019s unique flavor through a two-stage process called curing. Curing first requires trimmed buds to be hung upside-down for a week in 70-degree surroundings with consistent 50% humidity. Once sufficiently dry, the buds should be sealed in airtight containers and stored in slightly more moist conditions of 60-65% humidity; as Ucure, buds should regularly be checked for mold or mildew. Although initially popular in Amsterdam, Apple Kush is gaining ground in the U.S. cannabis market. Its novelty flavor profile and dynamic, easygoing high make it a great choice for hanging with friends or taking some calm and introspective solo time.

The strain\u2019s original L.A. breeder claims that while one parent was an OG Kush plant, the other was an unnamed Northern Lights phenotype brought back from Mardi Gras in New Orleans; this unnamed mother strain affectionately came to be known as \u201cBubba,\u201d and has since been lost. Prior to 1998, Bubba Kush was only available as a clone, but it has since been replicated so that its seeds could be packaged and sold. Bubba Kush is a classic indica with a solid sedative high that leaves users relaxed but still functional. It has a typically high THC content, ranging from 15% to 22%. Bubba Kush has small to medium sized buds that have the dense bud structure characteristic of indica varieties. The leaves are dark green and can sometimes show shades of purple, the result of anthocyanin pigments having been activated by cold temperatures during the growing process. This is a very resinous strain -- a coating of white trichomes covers the colorful leaves, and are even visible on the inside when buds are broken open. The flowers have a vague aroma of coffee or cocoa, with some slight fruitiness beneath. When burnt, Bubba Kush smells more hashy and spicy, as might be expected of a Kush, with smoke that is fairly harsh and cough-inducing. Notably, this is one strain whose purple flowers do not result in a grape-like taste: the pigments that determine Bubba Kush\u2019s color do not affect flavor. The taste is mostly dank, with some sweetness and a peppery kick in the exhale. This is also a particularly pungent strain -- users concerned about discretion should plan accordingly. Unusually for such an indica-heavy strain, Bubba Kush\u2019s high begins with a warped, disoriented sensation in the head. This fogginess, however, gives way to a more expected body melt that intensifies as the high wears on. Although not necessarily energized, smokers can maintain mental focus and converse or perform tasks as needed. Mostly, users will experience heavy, slow-breathing relaxation and a palpable sense of physical comfort. Couchlock is uncommon, leaving users functional and alert. \u00a0Bubba Kush\u2019s medical uses are mental as well as physical -- it can provide some relief from anxiety and depression in addition to soothing chronic, deep-seated aches and pains. In large enough doses, it can serve as treatment for insomnia as well. Many users describe increased appetite as a common side effect. Well-suited to nighttime or lazy daytime use, Bubba Kush\u2019s stimulation of both body and mind makes it great for activities that involve both -- including, but not limited to, exercise and sex. Bubba is a relatively easy to grow and is recommended for newcomers to cannabis cultivation. \u00a0Stocky and bushy like most other indica varieties, its plants can be grown indoors, outside, or in a greenhouse. Outdoors, the strain has the advantage of being naturally resistant to molds and other pests, but growers will have to ensure consistent sunlight and a constant daytime temperature between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Bubba Kush grows well indoors in soil, but may have a higher yield if grown in hydroponic solution. The strain flowers between 8 and 9 weeks when gropwn \u00a0indoors and is ready for harvest outdoors in early October. Though the yield for the plants of this strain is typically lower -- from 32 to 35 grams (or 1 to 1.2 ounces) per square foot -- the quality of the flowers is very high. The dense buds are covered in sticky trichomes, making them valuable for curing and direct sale as well as for production of hash and other concentrates. Growers should be sure to properly cure the mature buds by hanging them upside down for about a week in a room that maintains 50% humidity and a consistent temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit; and then sealing the dried buds in wide-mouthed jars in a room with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 60-65% humidity.

Obsoul33t\u2019s current endeavor Franchise Genetics (already known for its cultivation efforts with various Alien lines) developed Orange Cookies as a cross between Girl Scout Cookies and Orange Juice. Alternatively, some claim that a phenotype of Girl Scout Cookies called Forum Cookies -- and not Girl Scout Cookies itself -- is this strain\u2019s parent. In any case, Orange Cookies\u2019 potency and bag appeal are clear -- it won 2nd Best Hybrid Flower in the 2015 High Times Cannabis Cup and carries a THC composition that ranges from 15% to 20%. Orange Cookies has medium-sized hairy buds that hold the dense structure typical of indica varieties. Its leaves are a bright green punctuated by hints of purple; this latter color is the product of pigments called anthocyanins in the leaves reacting to colder than average temperatures during the growing process. Orange pistils contrast with these colorful flowers. This strain\u2019s high resin content is made obvious by the presence of a coating of milky-white trichomes that makes it sticky and particularly difficult to break up by hand. Orange Cookies has an arresting smell to match its striking visuals. An overpowering smell of fresh and tangy citrus wafts up from the buds; it may remind some cannabis aficionados of pungent sativa Tangie. Breaking or grinding up the dense buds brings out a peppery herbal kick to complement the smell of orange zest. When combusted, flowers burn smooth and have a pleasantly sugary-sweet taste on exhale with a hint of funk. Notably, despite Orange Cookies\u2019 purple hues, no grape or berry flavors are present -- the pigments that determine this strain\u2019s color do not have a corresponding effect on its taste. Orange Cookies\u2019 effects take hold of users quickly, with a buzzy and energetic feeling in the head. This rush is soon met with a palpable body high that is relaxing without being too heavy or immobilizing. As users settle into the high, they may feel motivated and more thoughtful than usual -- but this strain\u2019s stoney indica feeling keeps users grounded, preventing them from careening into an overly cerebral, paranoid experience. Because of these well-rounded effects, Orange Cookies is a great strain for enhancing active pursuits like hiking or exercising, as well as more contemplative, creative tasks. It is as enjoyable as a daytime \u201cwake and bake\u201d strain as it is at night. Its versatility also makes Orange Cookies a valuable strain for medical cannabis patients. Its contended and lucid mood elevation can be a great way to relieve the troubling symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety; as a bonus, its middle-of-the-road effects mean that those already suffering from anxiety need not worry about paranoia. Orange Cookies\u2019 numbing body high can relieve chronic aches and pains. If higher doses are consumed, it can also help bring about deep and refreshing sleep. Depending on the individual user\u2019s tolerance, undesirable side effects include the standard dry mouth and bloodshot eyes. Seeds of Orange Cookies are not yet available for commercial sale, making this a \u201cclone only\u201d strain; prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature plants of Orange Cookies in order to grow genetically identical crops. It can be successfully grown indoors or out, although, as with any cannabis strain, indoor grow operations afford more exacting control over ambient conditions. Growers should make sure they top off the short, bushy plants, trimming any broad fan leaves that could block light and air from reaching the lower branches. When grown indoors, Orange Cookies flowers within 7 to 9 weeks and offers growers a low to medium yield of flowers. As with parent strain Girl Scout Cookies, the plants may need staked supports like wooden dowels in order to keep its flowering buds from drooping on overburdened branches. It may not help prevent scurvy, but Orange Cookies is a great choice for some mellow, thoughtful unwinding at any time of day.

One\u00a0hit from this strain initially hits the brain with\u00a0trippy feelings that\u00a0are more commonly experienced from Sativa strains. The buzz gradually settles in the body and promotes feelings of relaxation.\u00a0 The high lasts for around 2 hours, during which time it promotes feelings of happiness, relaxation and elation. Moreover, Alien Kush frees the mind from lockdown and encourages creativity, which makes it perfect for recreational use. In addition, its ability to relax helps to soothe pain, headaches and nausea as well as increasing appetite and uplifting mood (and consequently fight depression). This makes it suitable for medicinal use as well. Alien Kush was first grown by The Cali Connection. It grows well in both hydro and soil, and the growth is complemented by trimming and the addition of organic nutrients. Although this strain has average yields (around 300g per square meter) it is hardy and easy to grow.

A cross of indica Blueberry and sativa Haze, it offers a universally appealing taste and a long-lasting, well-rounded high. Smokers enjoy the ideal balance of cerebral stimulation and physical relaxation. After enjoying a cult following in California, it has become a top seller in Colorado and Washington. Thanks to aggressive branding, it may soon find a home in newly legal east coast cannabis markets as well. Samples of Blue Dream have tested at between 15% and 25% THC. Blue Dream has small to medium-sized buds that, when cured, have a popcorn-like, nugget shape. The leaves are primarily dark green. Interestingly, few phenotypes show the blue to lavender hues so often associated with parent strain Blueberry. Blue Dream\u2019s plentiful trichomes are often clear in color, meaning that, while sticky to the touch, leaves don\u2019t always have the same silvery sheen as other resinous strains -- nevertheless, these flowers are very sticky and can be tricky to break up without use of a grinder. Buds of Blue Dream have a skunky-sweet smell with strong notes of berry and grape. There are also vaguely spicy and herbal undertones, evidence of the genetics inherited from parent strain Haze. This strain gives off a harsh smoke that can sting the sinuses and often induce coughing. On the exhale, the smoke retains a berry flavor, with some hints of herbs and musk. The odor from Blue Dream can linger for a while, and smokers concerned with discretion should take precautions. The complex high from this strain starts off with a bracing head rush that grabs users quickly. Some changes in perception -- like amplified sounds and colors -- may be noticeable, although not disorienting. This psychedelic effect may help smokers have an increased appreciation for music, art, or just rambling conversation. Blue Dream\u2019s head-focused effects are soon met with a palpable sense of physical relaxation that spreads throughout the body. For the duration of the high, users enjoy a balance of mental invigoration and physical calm that lends itself to their setting or mood. Socializing, exercise, sex, and even lazy daydreaming can all be enhanced by this strain. Blue Dream also has medical uses that are just as versatile. Its relaxing indica effects make it an effective analgesic for troubling aches and pains -- whether incidental, as in cases of injury, or chronic, due to conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia . Its mellow euphoria can also relieve some symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Many users have also described improvement in the severity of migraines. Finally, in large enough doses, Blue Dream can have semi-narcotic properties to help treat those suffering from insomnia. \u201cTrue\u201d Blue Dream may only be available for cultivation as a clone; luckily, this strain\u2019s popularity means that many growers freely circulate clippings. Packaged seeds are also available for sale, although these may come from \u201cimitation\u201d Blue Dream varieties, bred from Blueberry and OG Kush. It can be grown outdoors in humid, Mediterranean-like climates, and has the advantage of being resistant to mildew -- although growers should know that Blue Dream can also be vulnerable to spider mites. The plants are relatively short and bushy with wide lateral branches, making them easy to grow indoors. Growers will want to practice \u201ctopping\u201d in the vegetative stage by trimming broad fan leaves at the tops of plants in order to allow sunlight and air to circulate among lower branches. Blue Dream flowers within 10 weeks when cultivated inside and offers a higher than average yield of 56 grams (or about 2 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant. Enjoying wide availability and a high that\u2019s friendly to novices and experienced users alike, Blue Dream shows no sign of losing its status as one of the most popular strains in the U.S. Boasting large amounts of sticky, THC-filled resin, it\u2019s an excellent choice for making hash and other concentrates that distill its psychoactivity as well as its herbal-berry goodness. \u00a0Blue Dream\u2019s great taste along with its mellow and malleable effects make it a great strain to share with friends or to enjoy alone for some low-key introspection."], "attributes": {"anxiety": 100, "pain": 80, "energetic": 60, "relaxed": 60, "euphoric": 100, "creative": 80, "appetite": 60, "cotton mouth": 20, "depression": 80, "nausea": 60}}], "jack plant": [{"source": "FOURTWENTY101", "kind": [0, 100, 1], "description": "The \\x93Jack Plant\\x94 by Advanced Seeds is a selected and backcrossed phenotype of the world famous cannabis variety, Jack Herer.

Equal parts cerebrally intense and physically relaxing, Blueberry Pie is well suited to use in a variety of contexts. It\u2019s a great example of what cannabis crossbreeding has to offer. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found at least one sample of Blueberry Pie flower to have approximately 20% THC content. Blueberry Pie is distinguished by medium-sized, spade-shaped nuggets. The flowers hold the tight bud structure that is so typical of indica strains, with compact, tightly-coiled leaves and a dense weightiness. The flowers themselves are an earthy brownish-green with yellow pistils. Some phenotypes may show off vibrant shades of purple, a color passed on from grandparent strain Blueberry that is caused by large concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins that trigger blue and purple hues when exposed to cold temperatures during the growing process. Also passed on from the Blueberry and Blue Dream strains is the unmistakable scent of fresh blueberries, a fruity tang that jumps off of the dried buds. Some dank and musty notes hang underneath this sweetness and speak to the funky Kush legacy, passed on from Girl Scout Cookies. When combusted, Blueberry Pie has a smoke that is thick and lung-expanding but smooth. On the exhale, this smoke has a lingering flavor of overripe fruit, sweet and skunky at the same time. This terpene-heavy strain is known to be particularly pungent, and smokers looking to keep their consumption discreet should take any necessary precautions. The high from Blueberry Pie sets in quickly and begins as a headrush -- before they\u2019ve even finished savoring this strain\u2019s taste, users may feel a growing pressure behind the eyes and around the temples, accompanied by a marked increase in thoughtfulness. A sharpened perception of smokers\u2019 surroundings can manifest with trippy and psychedelic sensations like visual distortions or intensifications of sounds. As users find their brains pushed into a stimulated, free-associative mode, they may also feel more chatty or giggly. As the high wears on, however, Blueberry Pie\u2019s cerebral high is grounded out by a powerful body stone. Heavy limbs and a tingling sensation may make users want to sit down if they\u2019re not already doing so. A calm (but still clearheaded) mindset takes over, creating feelings of relaxation and contentment. Blueberry Pie\u2019s high can be channeled into whatever pursuit users prefer -- it can provide daytime motivation to accomplish a lengthy to-do list, or can creative the perfect environment for creative thinking or problem solving. Blueberry Pie also has several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its holistic, all-over buzz can be a great way for those suffering from depression, anxiety, or PTSD to gain a new perspective and temporarily live \u201cin the moment.\u201d Its sense of focus can also be beneficial for those with attention deficit disorders. Physical effects include relief from aches and pains -- whether incidental and caused by injury or chronic and nerve-related, due to disease. In high enough doses, Blueberry Pie can also be an effective insomnia treatment. Seeds of this relatively uncommon strain are not available for commercial sale. Those looking to grow Blueberry Pie at home must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants which can then be grown as genetically identical \u201cclones.\u201d If growers are lucky enough to get their hands on some clones, Blueberry Pie can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation always requires a warm, semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70s. Those looking to bring out this strain\u2019s colorful purple highlights should also \u201cshock\u201d plants by exposing them to colder than average temperatures at night, just before flowering. Although limited information is available on cultivation of Blueberry Pie, we know that its Blue Dream and GSC parent strains flower after a long 9 to 10 weeks. Both parent strains also offer a solid yield of about 2 ounces per plant, perhaps providing some indication of what Blueberry Pie growers can expect. An ideal wake-and-bake strain or simply a great way to pass a lazy night at home, Blueberry Pie imparts a comfortable glow with its well-balanced high. With excellent genetics from two very popular parent strains, it stands to gain even more popularity beyond its current fan base."], "attributes": {"anxiety": 60, "pain": 100, "relaxed": 100, "arthritis": 80, "euphoric": 100, "creative": 60, "migraines": 60, "cotton mouth": 20, "depression": 40, "dry eyes": 20}}], "sour power": [{"source": "FOURTWENTY101", "kind": [0, 100, 1], "description": "Hortilab Seed\\'s super pungent, \"Sour Power\" is a skyrocketing Sativa dominant hybrid variety that churns out above average amounts of highly resinous flowers in a fairly short amount of time.

Blue Hawaiian was created by Jordan of the Islands, a prolific breeding operation based in scenic Vancouver Island, British Columbia. This boldly-flavored strain offers a balanced high that combines the best of its relaxing indica and stimulating sativa genetics. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured Blue Hawaiian\u2019s THC composition at between 12% and 20% with one test reaching as high as 24%. Blue Hawaiian has small to medium-sized flowers that, once cured, take clumpy, popcorn-like shapes. Leaves are tightly coiled in a dense and heavy bud structure, typical of indica varieties. The leaves themselves are a bright lime green and provide a contrast for fiery orange hairs threaded throughout the flowers. These hairs are actually pistils, reproductive structures meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants. In certain phenotypes of Blue Hawaiian, the buds are also streaked with blue and purple hues -- these latter colors are the result of high concentrations of anthocyanin pigments (passed on from parent strain Blueberry) that are stimulated by cold temperatures during the growing process. These colorful flowers are dotted with glassy white trichomes, making them sticky and difficult to break up for joints or pipes without the aid of a grinder. Like its cousin strains xxxx, Blue Hawaiian has a fruity, tropical scent redolent of pineapple and lemon. Meanwhile, a musky blueberry smell hangs out in the background. This strain burns smooth and easy, and its smoke leaves a woody, piney taste when exhaled. Notably, blue and purple-tinged flowers of Blue Hawaiian do not necessarily have a blueberry or grape taste; this is because the pigments that determine the leaves\u2019 color does not have any effect on their smell and taste. Blue Hawaiian has a high that mounts slowly, sometimes taking several minutes to hit users with its force. Smokers may detect a marked improvement in mood, accompanied by a warm tingle that spreads gradually throughout the body. This simultaneous physical and mental relaxation can have psychedelic effects, like visual distortions or the sensation of time dilation. Trippy experiences notwithstanding, users typically feel lucid and able to focus for the duration of the high. As such, Blue Hawaiian can be a great way to complement anything from creative productivity to exercise to sex. This strain is also valuable for medical cannabis patients. It can soothe chronic aches, pains, and even headaches. It can stoke hunger for those who have lost their appetite to illness or chemotherapy. And although an average high is free from couchlock, in large enough doses, Blue Hawaiian can bring about deep and restful sleep for those suffering from insomnia. Psychologically speaking, this strain can be effective in temporarily blunting the troubling symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety. Its sense of sustained focus can also benefit those with attention deficit disorders. Jordan of the Islands has made seeds of Blue Hawaiian available for sale; prospective growers may also be able to obtain clippings from healthy plants in order to grow genetically identical\u00a0\u201cclones.\u201d This strain can be grown indoors in closely-monitored conditions or in outdoors in Mediterranean-like climates with average daily temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Because of the sativa in its genes, plants of Blue Hawaiian are medium tall and can reach heights of 5 to 6 feet. When cultivating indoors, growers should train their plants by trimming and pruning branches early on in the growing process. Growers looking to bring out this strain\u2019s full bag appeal should also artificially \u201cshock\u201d its pigments into producing vibrant purple hues by exposing the plants to cold temperatures just before flowering. As is also typical of sativas, Blue Hawaiian takes a long time to flower -- growers should expect to harvest their buds after 9 to 10 weeks when growing indoors. This strain can yield as much as 15 to 30 grams (or \u00bd to 1 ounces) per plant. Blue Hawaiian\u2019s long-lasting euphora proves that a strain\u2019s flavor doesn\u2019t have to come at the expense of its potency.

The sticky flowers are threaded through with red to orange pistils. Chemdawg has a smell reminiscent of diesel fuel (which many say is the source of the \u201cchem\u201d in its name). The pungent flowers also give off odors of earthy musk and some pine. As long as flowers are properly cured, this strain has smooth smoke that tastes sour and when inhaled. On the exhale, Chemdawg\u2019s smoke betrays its signature diesel taste with an ammonia-like tang that hits the top of the palate. The high from Chemdawg hits quickly, sometimes before users have had a chance to finish appreciating its distinctive diesel aroma. Smokers may experience a sharpening of the senses and an increased hyper-awareness of their surroundings. This initially disorienting head high becomes more productively cerebral and introspective in the right set and setting. Chemdawg can lend itself to exuberant conversation. Its ability to amplify sensory experiences also makes it particularly good for creative endeavors. Many users report a palpable sense of physical relaxation -- although nothing near couchlock -- leading to some speculation that Chemdawg has some indica in its genetics as well. Chemdawg\u2019s strong cerebral high has made it valuable in treating some of the symptoms associated with stress, anxiety, and even PTSD. Some fans of the strain describe relief from chronic pain and migraines as well. Because of its potency and mental focus, Chemdawg has the potential to trigger the kind of manic, recursive thinking that can lead to paranoia. As such, even users with a high tolerance for THC are advised to moderate their intake accordingly. Chemdawg is a strain whose cultivation is better suited to more experienced growers. For a while, it could only be grown as a clone if a clipping was obtained from a mature plant; now, however, many seed companies sell packaged seeds of Chemdawg. It is more often grown indoors than outdoors, as it requires a good amount of tending to resist mold and mildew. Growing indoors takes some vigilance -- the sativa-typical plants often grow over 5 feet tall, and as such, growers should bend and prune them early in the vegetative stage in order to keep them at a manageable height. Plants flower within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and typically offer a very high yield: growers can expect between 65 and 75 grams, or 2.3 and 2.6 ounces, per square footage of plant. Such high yields on such relatively tall plants can make for branches that sag under the weight of the flowers; growers should use tall supports like wooden dowels in order to keep plants upright in the flowering stage. Finally, because of Chemdawg\u2019s pungency, any growers preoccupied with secrecy or discretion should invest in indoor odor-control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans. Chemdawg\u2019s potency has made it a valuable strain for crossbreeding. Its descendant strains include the phenotype Chemdawg 91 as well as the hugely popular hybrids Sour Diesel and OG Kush. More likely to keep users awake then put them to sleep if consumed at night, it has an almost eye-watering pungency and energizing and thought-stimulating effects. Chemdawg can be a great choice for accomplishing tasks, as well as for more celebratory circumstances as it keeps heads buzzing and conversation flowing."], "attributes": {"anxiety": 80, "pain": 100, "relaxed": 60, "euphoric": 100, "creative": 40, "appetite": 40, "dry eyes": 40, "cotton mouth": 40, "depression": 60, "nausea": 40}}], "taco": [{"source": "QANNABIS", "kind": [0, 0, -1], "description": "\\xa0", "attributes": {}}], "phatt fruity": [{"source": "FOURTWENTY101", "kind": [100, 0, 1], "description": "Barney\\x92s Farm Seeds super awesome, \\x93Phatt Fruity\\x94 stands up to it\\x92s name by producing \\x93Phatt\\x94 amounts of very powerful \\x93Fruity\\x94 ganja that, once cured, bares an unforgettable blueberry flavor and aroma.

It\u2019s a cross between tasty Grapefruit and High Times Indica Cup winner God Bud. Grape God comes to us from Next Generation Seed Company, innovative breeders based in beautiful British Columbia. This strain\u2019s flashy bells and whistles don\u2019t come at the expense of its potency: cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found flowers of God Bud to have between 15% and 25% THC content. Its heavy, peaceful body stone is best savored around bedtime. Grape God boasts tapered flowers that adhere in large single pieces. The buds have a dense indica-like structure, with tightly curled leaves. The leaves themselves are a spring green and, more often than not, are streaked with hues ranging from pale lavender to deep violet; these latter colors come about when high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins (inherited from colorful God Bud) are agitated by cold weather during the growing process. A blanket of icy trichomes covers the eye-catching flowers, making them sticky and difficult to break up without the help of a grinder. As might be expected from its lofty name, Grape God packs the unmistakable scent of grape -- although an underlying sweetness makes the flowers smell more like grape gummy candy than actual grapes. On second inspection, there are also some funky notes of damp earth. The absence of skunky or acrid flavors in this strain makes for a smooth, easy smoke that tastes dank on the exhale. Notably, there is no correspondence between Grape God\u2019s purple color and its grape-like taste: while the color is dictated by pigments, different compounds called terpenes determine the taste. Grape God may take several minutes -- or a second bowl -- to take hold of smokers. Effects start in the head, with a gradual heaviness that moves down through the neck to the shoulders and limbs. This \u201cstoney\u201d feeling is soon accompanied by a wave of relaxation that helps put users at ease. Provided that they feel safe and are planted in the right set and setting, users may then feel tensions and worries evaporating under Grape God\u2019s indica influence. This strain does not impair cognition as heavily as some more pure indicas, but users may not feel motivated to work on detailed tasks, even if they can maintain focus. Medically speaking, Grape God\u2019s relaxing properties make it very useful to a variety of patients. It can soothe pain resulting from injuries or from chronic conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia. Its pleasant emotional buzz can blunt the harsh symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and even PTSD. This strain can also be a powerful appetite stimulant. Because of the relative lack of intense cerebral effects, Grape God also comes with a lessened risk of paranoia. The high can last longer than average, even for more experienced consumers. Seeds of Grape God are available from several online retailers. It can also be obtained the old fashioned way, as cuttings from mature plants of the same variety that can then be grown as genetically identical \u201cclones.\u201d This strain can thrive indoors or outdoors, although outdoor growing requires a warm, humid climate with consistent temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Its short and bushy plants can easily be maintained indoors, but growers should be sure to \u201ctop\u201d their crops, trimming away any large, light-blocking fan leaves. Growers should also be sure to bring out Grape God\u2019s signature purple color by \u201cshocking\u201d the plant, or exposing it to cold temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Grape God has a short flowering period of 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors. Growers are rewarded for their labor with typically high yields. More of an evening or nighttime strain than a wake and bake booster, Grape God is a go-to for relaxation and relief.

It is a bold and sticky variety that\u2019s well adapted to a variety of growing conditions. Durban Poison boasts a THC content of between 15% and 25%. Cannabis has been cultivated on the African continent since at least the 14th century; by the era of Dutch colonization, it had spread south and the Khoikhoi, San, and Bantu groups indigenous to South Africa had an established cultivation and cultural acceptance of the drug, which they called dagga. In the late 1970s, American breeder Ed Rosenthal selectively bred several plants from a bag of South African seeds that he brought back to the U.S. Rosenthal then passed some prime specimens on to fellow breeder Mel Frank, who fine-tuned the genetics to optimize resin content and flowering time. Frank\u2019s efforts resulted in \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d lines of the original seed stock; the B line was given to Amsterdam breeder Sam the Skunkman, who further reduced the strain\u2019s flowering time. Buds\u00a0of Durban Poison are medium to large in size. Although they have a dense, compact structure typical of indica varieties, their long and tapered shape is more characteristic of sativas. The forest green leaves are offset by bright orange pistils, meant to catch pollen from male fertilizing plants. A coating of milky-white trichomes gives the cured flowers a light sheen and an incredibly sticky texture. Durban Poison has a classically dank smell punctuated by hints of sweet licorice. The flowers are pungent and skunky when broken open or burnt and give off a thick, lung-expanding smoke. The licorice aroma is evident on the exhale, along with the taste of sweet, almost cloying pine sap. Durban Poison has a clear, focused high that hits users right away. The amplification of sights and sounds may be initially disorienting but in the right setting can slide into an active, buzzy head high. Almost entirely cerebral with no hints of debilitating heaviness or couchlock, this strain can be especially helpful for creative endeavors -- it\u2019s a great way to contemplate the nuances of an intense movie or a piece of music. Durban Poison can also be a strong social lubricant, helping smokers to feel chatty and more at ease. Any medical benefits are more mental than physical -- this strain can confer a sense of mindfulness to help those perpetually distracted by depression, anxiety, and PTSD. It can also help those with attention deficit disorders maintain a deep, intense focus. Because it\u2019s so potent and cerebral, Durban Poison can also have some undesirable side effects. It may put users into overdrive, making them feel on edge or jittery. It can also lead to a kind of rapid-association \u201cmindrace,\u201d making smokers feel paranoid or out of control. Definitely more suited to daytime than sleepy nighttime use, Durban Poison is a quintessential wake and bake strain. Its high typically lasts between 2 and 3 hours. Because of its hardy and time-tested genetics, Durban Poison is a good grow for newcomers to cultivation. It can reach 12 feet in height, and as such, can be successfully grown outdoors in warm, semi-humid climates with consistent daily temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Indoor growers will want to tame Durban Poison\u2019s height by bending and pruning the spindly branches early on in the vegetative stage. Thanks to its time-tested cultivation and internationally-engineered genetics, this strain flowers remarkably quickly for a sativa, reaching maturity in 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and by late September when grown outdoors. Plants also reward growers with a higher than average yield. Named after South Africa\u2019s second largest city, Durban Poison offers a chance to enjoy one of Africa\u2019s contributions to the panoply of potent global landrace strains. It has a sweet, hashy smell and a high resin content that makes it particularly valuable in the production of THC concentrates like shatter and wax.

This strain is a cross between super-sticky Aspen OG and Skunk-derived High Country Diesel, both pungent varieties themselves. Also known as G6, it was created by Colorado-based breeders 303 Seeds. Jet Fuel\u2019s cerebral intensity is well suited to situations that call for deep creative thinking and problem solving. It has a THC content that ranges from 15% to 20%. Buds of Jet Fuel are marked by medium-sized flowers that taper down into almost conical shapes. The bud structure is more sativa than indica, with relatively light and fluffy leaves that tear away easy from central stems. The leaves themselves are an earthy brownish-green, while the pistils range from orange to rarely-seen shades of maroon and red. When properly cured, flowers of Jet Fuel are covered in trichomes and leave behind a sticky resin when handled. This strain\u2019s name doesn\u2019t only account for its energetic nature, it\u2019s also a reference to the sweet tang of gasoline that wafts from the flowers. Like parent strain High Country Diesel, Jet Fuel packs a fuel-like chemical punch. Grinding or burning the sticky flowers gives off a whiff of pine as well, calling to mind Jet Fuel\u2019s OG Kush lineage. As with many other sativas, the smoke generated by this strain is smooth, although the skunky diesel aftertaste may leave many smokers reaching for a glass of water. This pungent flower may not be the best choice for those looking to keep their consumption discreet. Uncharacteristically for a sativa, Jet Fuel may take a few minutes before it blasts off, giving users a surge of energy and euphoria. Some initial physical effects can be detected as a pressure around the eyes and temples, but this strain otherwise lives entirely in the head. If waking and baking, consumers may feel endured with the energy needed to plow through a busy day. In more relaxed setting, Jet Fuel can bring about a stimulating creative environment -- the constant sense of associative thinking can be a great asset to brainstorming, visualization, or just free-flowing conversation. Jet Fuel is definitely not a strain to enjoy before bed time, even for those with a high tolerance for THC. Medically speaking, Jet Fuel can have psychological benefits for patients. The acute sharpening of the senses can be a big asset in helping users live more fully \u201cin the now\u201d if they're burdened by symptoms of stress and anxiety. This strain\u2019s cerebral focus can also aid those with attention deficit disorders. Because of its potency and its tendency to induce recursive, obsessive thinking, Jet Fuel is not recommended for patients or recreational users who are prone to anxiety or paranoia. 303 Seeds has made packaged seeds of Jet Fuel available online; it can also be grown as a clone if clippings are obtained from a mature plant. This is considered a moderately difficult variety to grow -- it requires close monitoring of temperature and humidity and, as such, growers may have more success tending to it indoors. Growers should also \u201ctop\u201d their plants, cutting away any broad fan leaves that might block light and air from reaching the lower branches. Jet Fuel flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors. It offers a somewhat lower than average yield, at about 37 grams (or 1.3 ounces) per square foot of plant. Growers should also take care to properly cure the harvested buds in order to preserve Jet Fuel\u2019s taste and potency. This process involves first drying the buds by hanging them upside down for about a week in a room that maintains 50% humidity and a consistent temperature of 70 degree Fahrenheit; and then sealing the dried buds in wide-mouthed jars in ambient surroundings of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and between 60-65% humidity. With a racing head high and an aroma reminiscent of a piney car freshener, Jet Fuel is sure to turn some heads of its broken out at a party.

Purple Urkle has a sweet and skunky smell generally containing the aromas of tropical fruit, grapes, fruity pebbles and skunk.

According to seed distributor Sensi, Bid Bud originated in the U.S. in the 1980s as a possible cross between early staple strains Afghani, Haze, and Northern Lights and spread quickly through the then-underground market. During the War on Drugs initiated by Richard Nixon and furthered by Ronald Reagan, intrepid fans of Big Bud transported the strain to the cannabis safe haven of the Netherlands, where it was nurtured and genetically stabilized. Fortunately, Big Bud has survived and has reclaimed popularity in the U.S. The strain won 1st prize in the \u201cMostly Indica\u201d category in the second-ever High Times Cannabis Cup in 1989. The THC composition of Big Bud varies from about 15% to about 20%. Cured flowers are huge by any standards of comparison -- the chunky buds are very resinous and adhere in large pieces, even when packaged in small quantities for sale. The spring green buds have fewer than average pistils, but hold a high volume of silver-white trichomes that make the buds look almost wet. Because of the high trichome count, these buds are also very sticky and invariably hard to break up by hand. The smell of the buds is just as bold, with a mostly dank and earthy scent undercut by some fruitiness. The Haze parent strain imparts some herbal spiciness as well. Notably, Big Bud has a genetic profile that\u2019s similar to popular hybrid Jack Herer -- both have parents in the Haze and Skunk families -- but Big Bud has more grape taste compared to Jack Herer\u2019s citrus. The smoke from Big Bud is smooth for an indica and finishes with a lingering sweet taste. Big Bud has a archetypally indica high with a very thick body stone. It can creep up on the user, sometimes taking several minutes to take hold. Users rarely report mental stimulation, instead describing a disorienting foggy feeling. Big Bud may also bring about some psychedelic symptoms like visual distortions and trippy time dilation. This lazy high, often descending into couchlock, is perfect for passive activities like watching movies or listening to your favorite music. The sense of relaxation that comes from Big Bud also has some medical benefits. It can ease aches and pains and more chronic pain conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia. Its narcotic qualities are also obviously helpful for those struggling with sleep -- Big Bud can induce deep and lasting sleep that may even leave users groggy and disoriented the next morning. Because of the dopey high it brings about, Big Bud isn\u2019t recommended for active daytime use or tasks that require a degree of concentration. It can be social in more low-key intimate contexts, and is easily enjoyed solo. Big Bud has height to match its outsized flowers -- plants can grow up to 7 feet tall. As such, it can be grown outdoors, but only in consistently warm climates with reliables sources of sunlight. Big Bud can be grown indoors as well, but because of its height requires early topping and bending in the vegetative stage to allow for more horizontal than vertical growth. The plant\u2019s support system is robust as well: the thick central stalks can grow to almost 2 or 3 inches in diameter, allowing the lateral branches to hold up this strain\u2019s famously hefty flowers, often without the need for supporting stakes. Big Bud flowers somewhat quickly for an indica, within 7 to 8 weeks, and has a medium-high yield. Plants can offer as much as 46 grams or about 1.5 ounces per square foot. Because of the size of Big Bud\u2019s flowers, the curing process, which usually takes about a week in temperature-controlled and humidity-controlled environments, make take 10 days or longer; buds are cured when they\u2019re dry to the touch, but not brittle. This strain is a testament to the importance of expert horticulture -- without the care and attention of master cannabis growers, Big Bud may have been lost or diluted. Fortunately, the strain\u2019s stabilization by Dutch cannabis enthusiasts has ensured its potency and continued popularity.

Created by G13 Labs, a European seed company responsible for many flavor-focused strains, Royal Kush is a cross between staple hybrid Skunk #1 and an Afghani indica landrace. With soothing physical effects and a blissful, dreamy high, this is a variety well suited to mellow nighttime use. According to cannabis testing lab Analytical 360, flowers of Royal Kush have been found to have THC levels of 15% to as much as 25% This impressive strain has medium to large flowers that ahdere in elongated, chunky buds. The buds have the tight and dense bud structure typical of many other indica varieties. The leaves are a vibrant spring green with yellowish pistils threaded throughout. Certain phenotypes also have shades of purple, a color that comes about when anthocyanin pigments in the plant are agitated by unusually cold temperatures during the growing process. Milky white trichomes cover the outer surfaces and inner crevices of the flowers and give the cured buds an extremely sticky, resinous texture that makes them difficult to break up by hand. Royal Kush has the full-bodied incense aroma of parent strain Afghani, with notes of pine and sandalwood. Underneath these scents is a sour, citrus-like tinge. When combusted, this strain gives off smoke that may seem remarkably smooth for an indica. On the exhale, users will detect a skunky-sweet taste with a little bit of fruit. Notably, Royal Kush has no discernible grape or berry flavors; the pigments that determine this strain\u2019s purple hues do not have a similar effect on its taste. Like Skunk #1, this is a very pungent variety -- smokers should double-bag their bud when transporting it and enjoy it in isolated locations. Royal Kush is a strain that slowly creeps up on the user with full-bodied physical relaxation. In the minutes following consumption, users may feel a tingle in the head and shoulders and shoulders that gradually spreads through the limbs and torso like a wave. Smokers may find themselves breathing and moving more slowly and may feel inclined to veg out in comfortable surroundings. Although some may feel an alteration in their thinking or perception, this takes more of a hazy, rambling character. Psychedelic effects like visual distortions or a sense of time dilation are common. These strong sedative properties make Royal Kush a valuable strain for medical cannabis patients as well. Its suppression of stress and tension is a great temporary treatment for acute symptoms of stress, anxiety, and even PTSD. It\u2019s also useful in treating anything from muscle soreness to entrenched nerve pain as the result of conditions like fibromyalgia and Parkinson\u2019s Disease. As more and more is consumed, this strain can lull users into an easy, restful sleep, providing relief from insomnia. Royal Kush is also known to be an effective appetite stimulant. This strain is potent and long-lasting, even for more experienced cannabis users. As such, smokers should consume in moderation at first. Packaged seeds of Royal Kush can be bought from its creator G13; alternatively, growers can obtain clippings from mature plants in order to grow genetically identical clones. This strain can be grown indoors or outdoors, although successful outdoor cultivation depends on a consistently warm, semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range.

Seeds of Hindu Kush -- along with seeds of other Asian landrace varieties like Afghani -- were brought to the U.S. in the 1960s and 70s by cannabis enthusiasts and explorers who traveled along a route that has come to be known as the \u201chippie trail.\u201d In time, Hindu Kush has, perhaps inevitably, been crossed with other strains to allow for stability and adaptation to a radically different climate than its mountainous point of origin; as such, \u201ctrue\u201d Hindu Kush may not be widely available in the Western Hemisphere. Nevertheless, Hindu Kush is a relatively pure strain, simpler and often more potent that the novelty crossbreeds that continue to multiply in today\u2019s competitive cannabis market. It is prized for its heavily sedative, almost narcotic properties and its highly resinous flowers. The THC composition of Hindu Kush is typically measured at between 15% and 20%. Hindu Kush is marked by large, clustered green buds that adhere due to their incredibly sticky consistency.\u00a0Some phenotypes have shades of purple in the leaves, the result of high concentrations of plant pigments called anthocyanins being activated by cold weather during the vegetative stage. The densely-packed flowers are famous for their resin (Hindu Kush may have been one of the first strains used to produce hash) and have a heavy coating of silver-white trichomes. The aroma of this strain is very complex, with a simultaneously sweet and musky scent, redolent of spice, sandalwood, pine, and wet earth. The musky odor intensifies when flowers are combusted and smoked. The resulting smoke is harsh and cough-inducing; when exhaled, smoke tastes vaguely like pine. The overall flavor impression of Hindu Kush is one of incense and herbs. Hindu Kush boasts a slowly-mounting high that begins as a sense of physical relaxation and then progresses toward a state of mental fogginess. Users will feel a heavy sensation in the limbs and head and may not want to be especially active. The feeling of couchlock is commonly reported: users may have thoughts or intentions of getting up to perform a task, but will just as happily remain motionless. This immobilization can free up the mind for lazy contemplation and meandering creative thinking. Some psychedelic effects like visual distortions and strange tactile sensations may also be present. Because of its heavy body stone, Hindu Kush is not recommended for active daytime use. Instead, it works well as a numbing agent for chronic pain, an anti-nausea treatment, and as a way to relieve stress and anxiety. Negative effects include dry mouth and eyes, occasionally accompanied by paranoia and dizziness. A few users have also reported experiencing anxiety from larger doses of this strain. Hindu Kush is particularly helpful for users with insomnia, as large enough doses can induce sleep. The purely indica lineage of Hindu Kush is evident in its stature. Indica plants are much shorter and stockier than their sativa counterparts, and the Hindu Kush strain epitomizes this, hardly ever growing taller than 5 feet. As such, it can be grown indoors, provided that multiple plants are spaced to allow for the strain\u2019s wide lateral branches. Outdoor cultivation tends to be more difficult, as the strain\u2019s native climate is highly variable. However, as noted, certain varieties of Hindu Kush have been stabilized through minor crossbreeding, so some phenotypes may grow well outdoors. Growers may want to trim low-lying branches (which can later be used to grow clones) to allow for easy air circulation. Growers should also trim broad fan leaves to allow light to penetrate to flowering nodes up and down the length of the plant. When cultivated indoors, Hindu Kush flowers anywhere between 7 to 10 weeks. If grown outside, plants are usually ready for harvest in late October. Hindu Kush can yield up to 1.5 oz per square foot and reach a THC count of up to 20%. Procuring Hindu Kush is a unique encounter for the cannabis novice and connoisseur alike. Shaped over countless generations of natural selection, its aromatic flowers offer a way to experience a piece of botanical and cultural history. The strain\u2019s powerful knockout high may introduce a new kind of respect for nature -- or at the very least, an understanding of why this plant has been selectively bred by humans for centuries. A true nighttime smoke, Hindu Kush is well-suited to solo use or to small intimate gatherings."], "attributes": {"anxiety": 40, "pain": 100, "insomnia": 100, "relaxed": 60, "sleepy": 80, "euphoric": 60, "sedated": 100, "appetite": 40, "cotton mouth": 40, "depression": 60}}], "armageddon": [{"source": "QANNABIS", "kind": [0, 0, -1], "description": "A strain used to create the hybrid Armageddon x Sirius.

While not an exact hereditary replica of Girl Scouts, Thin Mint Cookies is similar in its observable characteristics. The strain became a hybrid when crossed with OG Kush and Durban Poison. An almost perfectly balanced hybrid, Thin Mint Cookies is 50 percent Sativa and 50 percent Indica. The buds of Thin Mint Cookies smell like mint, hence the name, and taste sweet. Purple and dark green, this strain has a dense coat of crystals. As a hybrid and a copy of a legendary strain, Thin Mint marshals the forces of Indica and Sativa to give a powerfully blended potency. Thin Mint Cookie aficionados describe the sensation as both mental and physical. The body may feel sleepy and hungry, while the mind stays active and creative. This strain is for the medically needy as it treats the pain, nausea, and appetite loss often found in serious disorders. THC content is high but CBD levels are low, making it unsuitable to calm seizure sufferers. Choose it for the sleepy effect and the waves of pain relief. While it also alleviates insomnia, arthritis, and stress, casual and recreational users often choose this strain due to its name recognition. In 2013, Thin Mint Cookies' parent, Girl Scout Cookies, won 1st place for a Hybrid in the Cannabis Cup held in Denver, CO. The Thin Mint Cookie strain has placed in the top three in competitions in California and Washington. To differentiate the strains, experts in the laboratory focus on the terpene and cannabinoid profiles because all cannabis buds produce THC. High terpene found in Thin Mint Cookies suggests its ancestry to Girl Scout Cookies, the caryophyllene, limonene, and linalool say Kush, while THCV indicates Durban Poison. Because it is a child of famous strain, the hereditary lineage of Thin Mint Cookies is of interest. The original breeders of Girl Scout Cookies told High Times magazine that they crossed a mystery strain (F1) that they called their \"secret sauce\" with Durban Poison and OG Kush. High Times' laboratory analysis of a Girl Scout Cookie lookalike found (in percent mass): 1.16% CBG; 22.3% THC; 0.07% THCV; 0.17% linalool; 0.39% myrcene; 0.37% limonene; 0.71% caryophyllene.

Its THC level regularly reaches up to\u00a025 percent while its CBD content is quite low - generally around 0.5 percent. A child of two well established strains -\u00a0Fire OG Kush and The White -\u00a0White Fire OG has become quite popular throughout medical and recreational dispesnaries in the West. Originally bred\u00a0in the early 2000's it has built a\u00a0reputation for a unique look and routinely\u00a0high\u00a0potency. White crystals blanket the plant like snow on its barrel-shaped, tight buds. The smell is diesel fuel and earthy. Some have detected pepper and lemon in the taste while others have said it's more sweet, musky, and oaky.\u00a0 Although it tilts towards the Indica side,\u00a0Wifi OG has cerebral effects, offering energy and focus. The heady profile also means that people can use it in the morning and midday and not get too sleepy. For recreational users, this herb may be suited to creative and social activities. Because of the high THC and the low CBD, Wifi OG is not suited for medical patients with serious disorders like epilepsy. Instead, people with depression, anxiety, appetite loss, and pain find that it suits their needs. Some may find the smoke a bit harsh on the intake, which may not be suitable for people trying to avoid coughing due to pain or lung irritation. The first rush is strong and uplifting and people have reported 3-hour highs with this particular strain of\u00a0weed. Some have mentioned a localized feeling in the face and eyes that is warm and pleasant. \u00a0 The home grower will find different phenotypes of Wifi OG on the market\u00a0which stay true to the strain\u2019s profile in various degrees. For example, you may find plants with traditional barrel-shaped nugs - staying true to its original genetics -\u00a0or a more conical shape, which\u00a0recent breeders have begun cultivating. The aroma and taste may vary slightly as well and is continuously being improved upon. It was this type of genetic variation in cannabis that has spurred celeberties like Wiz Khalifa to develop their\u00a0own brand of Kush - see\u00a0Khalifa Kush.

Although these strains are generally considered to fit the definition of a landrace, cannabis did not actually exist in Jamaica until brought over by Indian indentured servants in the 1840s and 1850s when the British Empire ruled both Jamaica and India -- in fact, the word ganja, often used in Jamaica to refer to cannabis, is a variation of the Bengali word for hemp. The plant took quickly to Jamaica\u2019s tropical climate and has since become renowned for its potent cerebral effects. Often sought out by tourists in Jamaica, true Jamaican Strain can be difficult to come by elsewhere.\u00a0 The Jamaican cannabis plant may be almost unrecognizable to consumers of more commercially packaged bud. Once cured, leaves from the plant\u2019s long branches can appear sparse - they are thin and wispy and do not have the \u201cshrunken\u201d and compact appearance of indica and sativa hybrid buds. Leaves are forest green to dark green, with hairs that appear more brown than orange. Jamaican is famously pungent, with an almost eye-watering, skunky-sweet musk. The skunk scents are concentrated when this strain is burned. Users report inhaling a harsh, stinging smoke. A true sativa, Jamaican has pervasive cerebral qualities. The high has mellow, buzzing bodily effects but is mostly marked by stimulation of mental acuity. Euphoria and perceptions of clearer thinking are common. Those lucky enough to have enjoyed Jamaican Strain claim that they experience talkativeness and an increased feeling of sociability. This is an energizing daytime strain and beneficial for deep creative thinking. If you\u2019re able to obtain Jamaican Strain seeds for cultivation, an outdoor growing environment is best, as plants can quickly outgrow the confines of an enclosed environment. Jamaican plants will also thrive in a tropical climate, so sharing an approximate latitude with Jamaica is a benefit. This strain is best for growers with patience, as flowering can take as long as 5 months. Like many landraces, Jamaican Strain is prized for its stability and potency, having yielded popular crossbred strains like Lambsbread and Marley\u2019s Collie. However, in a market that prefers novelty crossbreeds, more traditional cannabis consumers and horticulturists consider the pure Jamaican landrace to be in danger of falling into obscurity.

It is a cross between Afghani-descended indica Shiskaberry and the sweetly-scented Cotton Candy Kush. It is the creation of the Vancouver-based Chimera Seeds, breeders who frequently experiment with Skunk and Blueberry varieties. In addition to having an appealingly earthy scent, flowers of C4 carry a THC content of between 15% and 22%. C4\u2019s flowers are impressively large and adhere in almost spherical chunks. This variety has a somewhat hybridized bud structure -- although the curly leaves are densely packed at their bases, they have a fluffy exterior texture and can be freely plucked from the central stem. The leaves are a vibrant spring green, with yellow to faint orange pistils that more or less blend in. The big buds are coated in syrupy trichomes, making this an especially difficult strain to break up by hand, fluffy leaves notwithstanding. After they\u2019re cured, buds of C4 have a mellow scent that is similar to moss and cedar. Sharp notes of lemon zest accentuate the predominantly woodsy odor. Breaking up or grinding the buds can give off a hashy, incense-like aroma, evidence of Afghani\u2019s influence in this strain\u2019s genetics. When burnt, C4 has a smooth, rich smoke that tastes of citrus and pine on the exhale. This strain offers a \u201dcreeper\u201d of a high that may not make itself known until several minutes after it\u2019s consumed. Smokers of C4 may eventually detect a pleasant slowdown in breathing and a loosening of any tensed-up joints or muscles. This relaxation comes with an emotional uptick that can range anywhere from contentment to soaring euphoria. While C4 may not induce intensely cerebral thinking, it can have create mental stimulation to make listening to music or watching movies a somewhat psychedelic experience. Because it works on both the mind and body, C4 can be a great accompaniment for activities that involve both, like creating art, exercising, and sex. Users should keep in mind that with increased consumption, indica effects take over and can bring about brain fog and couchlock. Its well-balanced effects make C4 a versatile strain for medical purposes. Not only can C4 take the edge off of a stressful day, it can also blunt the troubling symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Its strong sedative effects can treat aches and pains and it has the capacity to ease stomach pain. In high enough doses, C4 can relieve stubborn cases of insomnia. Although producers Chimera at one point released seeds of G4 for online sale, many suppliers seem to be out of stock. Those who want to grow this strain at home should obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of C4 in order to grow clones. This is a good strain for novice growers, as its landrace genetics make it particularly resistant to disease and mold. It can be successfully grown indoors or outdoors, but outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It fares well in closely-monitored conditions indoors; C4 grows short and bushy with horizontal branching and can fit in relatively small grow spaces. This strain flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and offers growers a high yield in return for their efforts. In fact, as flowering begins, growers may need to support the drooping branches with supports like wooden dowels. C4\u2019s versatility makes it suited for use at any time of day. It can provide the inspiration needed to help finish the tasks you\u2019ve been putting off. Alternatively, it can be just the thing to help you zone out after a long workday.

Tahoe Alien plants grow to a medium height. Its buds are of a conical shape and are of a light, minty green color with amber undertones and fiery orange hairs. The buds are large and stocky (they can be as much as three times the size of original Tahoe OG buds), and are extremely sticky due to the presence of a frosty layer of chunky, golden trichomes. This strain emits an exquisite earthy, piney aroma with hints of citrus, which makes it a perfect companion for a group smoke session.

Even though the Tahoe Alien is a super heavy strain, it is not excessively sedative or narcotic, which makes it perfect for evening or even afternoon use. The head rush it induces gives users a wonderful feeling of delight, and follows that up with boosts in creativity and appetite as well as helping in relaxation and sleep. This makes it perfect for recreational use. In addition to the aforementioned traits, Tahoe Alien also has numerous medicinal benefits. It helps to ease insomnia and nausea, while also alleviating stress, pain, muscle spasms and inflammations. This strain was first grown by Alien Genetics. Its buds can mature as early as 8 weeks \u2013 although 9 weeks is recommended to ensure maximum density and potency.

Its distinctive look and complex fruity flavor makes it an easy favorite -- to say nothing of its incredibly potent body high. Grape Ape is the product of strains as different as Mendocino Purps, an award-winning Northern California crossbreed, the influential staple strain Skunk, and a legendary Afghani landrace. The combination of these nuances has yielded a bold and visually striking variety. There are different varieties of Grape Ape, with seeds available from Washington State-based Apothecary Genetics and Barney\u2019s Farm, the seed bank responsible for creating other taste-focused strains like LSD and Pineapple Chunk. Testing lab Analytical 360 has tested samples of Grape Ape at between 15% and 25% THC composition. Grape Ape is marked by standout colors and multi-layered scents -- this is strain with more consumer \u201cbag appeal\u201d than most. Buds are large and have a dense bud structure with tightly-curled leaves. The leaves themselves are a deep green, with certain phenotypes expressing shades of purple and even red, with copper-colored pistils throughout. Trichome count varies from moderate to high, leaving the flowers especially sticky. The multicolored leaves are also very pungent: a candy-like grape smell wafts from the chunky buds. Breaking open the sticky flowers with a grinder gives off a different odor, with some skunky musk from the Skunk #1 parent and more of a thick hash scent from Afghani. When inhaled though, the slightly harsh smoke from Grape Ape tastes more fruity than skunky -- notes of grape and berries predominate, leaving behind a sweet sensation at the top of the palate. Notably, the grape taste and purple flavor of Grape Ape aren\u2019t necessarily correlated. Colorful leaves in cannabis are the result of pigments called anthocyanins activated by different conditions, like cooler temperatures. The tastes of different cannabis strains, on the other hand, are mostly determined by compounds called terpenes, and while many strains prone to producing purple leaves also have a combination of terpenes that create a grape-like flavor, not all purple strains taste like grape. In the case of Grape Ape, it may be the case that consumer-focused growers intentionally bring out purple hues for the added visual appeal. Grape Ape has a high that mounts slowly, eventually leading to a very weighty sensation in the head and limbs. Because of its slow onset, those enjoying Grape Ape should consume cautiously, keeping in mind that a little of this strain can go a long way. In ideal conditions, Grape Ape provides a palpable sense of both mental and physical relaxation, easing users into a spacey calmness. Rather than stimulating rapid-fire thoughts, Grape Ape offers a full body stone. Like the similarly simian-named hybrid Gorilla Glue, Grape Ape may leave you feeling like a clumsy, sleepy primate. Its indica strength makes Grape Ape a helpful strain for those suffering from nagging pain, whether due to temporary aches or more chronic conditions like fibromyalgia. It can also soothe sore muscles after strenuous exercise. Mentally, Grape Ape can melt stress and anxiety with the force of its foggy high. Definitely an after-dark strain, Grape Ape is great for inducing sleep. Grape Ape plants may be difficult for novices to cultivate. If grown outdoors, the strain tends to be resistant to both disease and destructive bugs. It can be easily grown indoors as well, given its indica shape: plants are bushy with strong lateral branches radiating from the central stem. Grape Ape plants rarely exceed 4 feet in height. Growers may want to practice topping, by trimming wide fan leaves at the top of the plant to allow light to reach lower branches. Grape Ape flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and produces a solid yield of medium to large flowers; growers can expect as much as 74 grams or about 2.5 oz of flower per square foot. Just as it\u2019s difficult for novice growers to cultivate, Grape Ape may be a tough smoke for cannabis newbies: its gradual and powerful high can be disorienting, even to experienced smokers. Extremely popular on the West Coast, Grape Ape is an excellent strain for users who want to feel pleasantly knocked out or overpowered.

Dutch Treat (also known as Dutch Crunch) is an indica-heavy hybrid that was originally cultivated in the Pacific Northwest but is now very popular in Amsterdam. With minimal CBD around 1% and THC between 15% and 30%, this is a potent strain that offers some physical benefits alongside its psychoactivity. A good option for nighttime socializing or introspection, Dutch Treat\u2019s potency earned it 3rd Best Sativa in the 2012 Southern California Cannabis Cup. There is no clear provenance on the lineage of Dutch Treat. However, many sources point to Jordan of the Islands, an experienced breeder from Vancouver Island, as the point of origin. Jordan of the Islands grows several staple strains as well as innovative crossbreeds that retail at dispensaries throughout the Vancouver area. Popular staple strains Northern Lights (another heavy indica with an earthy flavor profile) and Haze (a bold sativa with similarly wispy buds) have been suggested as parents of Dutch Treat, but without advanced genetic testing, we can\u2019t know for sure how Dutch Treat came to be. Despite its mysterious genetics, Dutch Treat has a clear \u201cbag appeal\u2019 that has made it attractive for innovative crossbreeding. One phenotype of the strain, Dutch Treat #5, has been used to create several other popular strains: combined with a Hawaiian sativa landrace, it\u2019s yielded High Definition; combined with Super Silver Haze, it has produced Dutch Treat Haze; and when crossed with Electric Haze, it\u2019s given us Electric Treat. Despite its indica dominance, Dutch Treats\u2019 buds are more sativa in appearance: they\u2019re tapered and conical rather than round, and their leaves are more wispy and soft than densely packed. The leaves themselves are a dark green with golden and yellow pistils underneath a thick coating of trichomes. Because of their high resin content and loose bud structure, buds of Dutch Treat may prove difficult to break apart for a pipe or a joint if you\u2019re not using a grinder. The aroma of this strain, while pleasant, isn\u2019t particularly memorable or pungent. Cured buds have a muted woodsy smell of cedar and pine accented by some nonspecific citrus sweetness. The smoke is surprisingly smooth and has the taste of herbs and more pine. For consumers who would rather not handle implements like joints, pipes, or vaporizers, cannabis company Bhang produces a packaged vape pen loaded with 25% THC Dutch Treat concentrate oil; even when vaped, this strain retains its distinctly herbal and earthy taste and smell. This strain hits the user quickly, with a euphoric head rush. Rather than cerebral stimulation, Dutch Treat brings emotional uplift that lends itself to sociability and some talkativeness. The head high soon gives way to a wash of physical relaxation. Those same initial cerebral effects might skew towards laziness or sleepiness as the high progresses. Users may experience some lethargy and, with higher doses, intractable couchlock. Aside from Dutch Treat\u2019s ability to ease tension, the strain\u2019s small amounts of CBD have been said to provide relief from chronic pain, nausea, and insomnia, as well as from mental afflictions like anxiety, PTSD, and attention deficit disorders. Common negative side effects include red, dry eyes and persistent dry mouth. Dutch Treat\u2019s slowly creeping body high makes it better suited to nighttime use. Consuming a small amount will go a long way -- users have described the high as lasting up to two hours, pending individual tolerance. When grown indoors, Dutch Treat can be controlled through trimming and topping of fan leaves to remain relatively bushy, reaching heights of up to 5 feet. If grown outside in a warm, temperate climate, though, Dutch Treat can climb much higher; as plants shoot up, growers may need to use stakes to keep branches standing upright before they begin to flower. If growing outdoors, cultivators should plan on keeping plants in a climate that doesn\u2019t waver beyond the ideal range of 72 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Dutch Treat has a higher than average yield: if grown successfully under ideal conditions, each plant can yield between 4 and 8 ounces of flower. Dutch Treat flowers within 6 to 8 weeks when cultivated indoors and as early as late September when grown outdoors. Dutch Treat is a good strain for relaxing, but not necessarily for being productive or socializing -- its indica leanings qualify this as an evening to nighttime strain. Dutch Treat\u2019s CBD content also makes it beneficial for medicating conditions involving chronic pain and digestion.

Winning first place in 2005 for best overall strain at the Oregon Medical Cannabis Awards, Dynamite can produce a strong but not overwhelming sedative effect, accompanied by an elevation in mood. It can be very effective as daytime medication for pain relief, nausea, and anxiety. The strain can be grown indoors, outdoors, or in a greenhouse. Even beginner growers will get relatively good results. As it grows short and uniform, the strain can do very well in the Sea of Green method. Indoors, the strain needs between six and seven weeks to finish flowering. Outdoors, in the Northern hemisphere, it is ready for harvest in early October.

San Francisco creators Cookie Fam Genetics have released multiple numbered phenotypes of Gelato - phenotype #33 has picked up the nickname Larry Bird in reference to the legendary player\u2019s jersey number. This strain has an indica-leaning high and carries a THC composition that ranges from 20% to 25%. Gelato\u2019s buds tend to be small but they have the thick and dense structure characteristic of many indica varieties. This is a strain with immediate visual appeal: bright orange pistils stand out against forest green leaves that are accented by shades of deep purple. The purple hues come about when high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins are stimulated by cold weather in the vegetative stage. Although the buds themselves are sticky, short stalks on the trichomes mean that this strain has a less frosty appearance than many others. Cured properly, flowers of Gelato have a predominant smell of pungent citrus, compliments of fruity parent strain Sunset Sherbert. Notes of yeast and dough can be detected as well. Grinding up or breaking apart the flowers gives off a more herbal, earthy profile. Though it\u2019s thick and lung-expanding, the smoke from Gelato is smooth and leaves behind a soft and creamy sensation -- perhaps going some way towards explaining its name. This is one pungent smoke, and those trying to keep their consumption discreet should take any necessary precautions. Gelato is known to hit users quickly, sometimes taking effect before they\u2019ve had a chance to even exhale. The most striking effect is a sense of altered perception and confusion, forcing smokers to adapt to their newly intensified surroundings. This head rush is met by a palpable body buzz that discourages much activity but still leaves users mobile and not couchlocked. Some describe Gelato as having amplified psychedelic effects like time dilation and sound sensitivity. The floaty and comfortable but still lucid feeling conferred by this strain makes it great for daytime or early evening use. Medically, Gelato has value as a way to treat chronic aches and pains with its powerful numbing effects. Some use it to medicate headaches and migraines as well. This strain\u2019s carefree elevation of mood can also offer temporary relief from the troubling symptoms associated with anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Gelato is said to be potent, even for more experienced cannabis users; newcomers should temper their consumption accordingly. That said, because of its lack of intense cerebral effects, this strain is not likely to put users into a deeply paranoid mindset. Seeds of Gelato are not commercially available, meaning that prospective growers may need to obtain plant trimmings in order to cultivate clones. If samples of Gelato are obtained, the strain can be particularly difficult to grow and is not necessarily recommended for novices. It can be grown in or outdoors. Outdoor cultivation requires consistently warm and humid conditions around 75 degrees Fahrenheit; indoor grow operations are more easily controlled and can accommodate the medium-height plants. In order to bring out this strain\u2019s full purple potential, growers should expose plants to colder temperatures just before the flowering period to stimulate the aforementioned anthocyanin pigments. Gelato flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in mid October when grown outdoors. Despite limited information on cultivation of this strain, we know that its Thin Mint and Sunset Sherbert parents have higher than average yields. Finally, this strain\u2019s pungency makes itself known during the growing process -- indoor growers should put odor control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans in place. Gelato has all the smooth and fruity appeal of Sunset Sherbert with the earthy, herbal goodness of Thin Mints.

This allows her plenty of time to get nice and big, while producing massive amounts of insanely resinous buds that appear as if they\\'ve been sprinkled with millions of miniature diamonds. Her flowers provide a very smooth and sweet Hazey flavor and aroma that\\'s not too strong or overpowering on your taste buds or in your pocket.

Mako Haze's cerebral effects can feel very intense, but generally they do not cloud the mind, especially in smaller doses. Instead, most users feel more focused and ready to tackle tasks and activities. Surprisingly, the number one reported negative effect is anxiety, with paranoia, dizziness, and cotton mouth tied for second. Reportedly, these effects appear more often when the strain is consumed in high doses, \u00a0through edibles, or for the first time. An excellent strain to use in the early morning, it provides a lasting burst of creative energy. It is prescribed to alleviate stress, anxiety, and depression-related disorders. Although Mako Haze has little effect on the body, some patients find it eases milder aches and pains. The uplifting effects of this hybrid may also be used to treat headaches and migraines.
