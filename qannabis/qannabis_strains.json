The color is either brownish gold or a mixture of gold and green. This grade has a potency surpassed by few of the green varieties and usually comes at slightly higher prices or in short weights.\"[4] According to one linguistics book, \"The gold in this phrase originally described the golden hue of the leaves on the marijuana plant, but later came to refer both to the high quality of the marijuana and to the especially high price it commanded.\"[5] Acapulco by itself can be used as a synonym for marijuana, generally referring to a high-grade type like Acapulco gold.[4][5] The similarly named Acapulco red, refers to a reddish-brown marijuana grown near Acapulco, Mexico with reddish tops on the plants.[5]"},

Sometimes, with 100% pure skunk varieties bred for indoor grow conditions it can be difficult to get good results when the plants are grown outdoors. Dutch Passion hybridised a carefully selected Skunk with a tough Indica strain to create Trance. Trance is an F1 hybrid which has come out as a particularly good quality variety that matures earlier than most. Outdoors it may be fully ripened by the end of September or 2nd week of October. Plants may reach 1-1.5m tall and can produce large leaves. Occasionally the plants turn a remarkable and beautiful red colour and deliver an excellent quality high that lasts for 2-3 hours. THC levels are 12-13% which is ample for a top quality supply of weed which retains the genuine skunk taste and flavours. Users report Trance is ideal for connecting with mother earth and making tantric spiritual journeys of the mind and soul. Trance is a strong reliable outdoor Skunk hybrid that has been popular with outdoor growers for many years. The high delivers a good quality, deep and escapist stone that will allow your mind and body to break away from the 21st century confines and find a true inner peace."},

There are several different phenotypes of the Girl Scout Cookies strain including Thin Mint and Platinum Cookies, which exhibit some variation in appearance and effect.
