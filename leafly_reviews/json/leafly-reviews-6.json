After pulling out SFV OG for me to see, my budtender was called away and replaced with another.  The girl asked if I was all set, and I said I’d like to see a few more strains.  She seemed shocked I didn’t want the SFV OG, as if no one who had ever checked it out had declined to get it.  I assured her that it would be coming home with me; I was simply looking for one in addition to, not instead of.  \n\nThe buds of SFV OG are perfect pyramids and are quite sticky to the touch.  For color, they seem to be marbled by light and dark greens, accented by dark brown hairs.  The smell is instantly sweet, and although there is also clearly a musky scent, it is tempered by pine.  The taste is like walking through a pine forest after a heavy rain.  Although the smoke is thick, it isn’t affecting.  \n\nSan Fernando Valley OG, much like its closest relative, OG Kush, is widely popular in the SoCal area.  Much of what makes it infamous comes from its mellow, full bodied high.  Both these strains seem to symbolize the region’s breezy personality.  I found SFV OG to be psychoactive in its effects.  Perfect for depression and anxiety, this high will help you to relax and unwind.  It is also physical enough to melt away tension in the neck, shoulders, and back.  I particularly enjoyed this strain after escaping from work for the day.  It was a great way to cast off my tie and welcome my leisure time.  \n\nhttp://ocweedreview.wordpress.com/","strain":"sfv-og","user":"OCWeedReview","stars":"3","date":"2/7/2014 8:08 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Euphoric","Pine","Pungent"],"ID":"126415"},{"_type":"dict","content":"It was ok, I had to smoke a lot because my high didn't last long...

As we saw in a previous review, Sour Diesel is much like sex.  Even when it’s bad, it’s still pretty good.  Mixing with this euphoric sativa is S.A.G.E. (Sativa Afghani Genetic Equillibrium).  S.A.G.E was bred to be the perfect 50/50 hybrid.  I feel a bit dirty messing with perfection, but the addition of Sour Diesel is simply the refining of an otherwise impeccable strain.\n\nThe buds of Sour Sage are light and airy.  My budtender had to practically shove the pop top closed, as the nuggets were overflowing the container.  They are oddly misshapen, almost pyramids, but only in the minds of the most devout cubists.  A blueish greenery is accented by topaz hairs and a fuzzy frosting of crystals.  When I dipped my nose into the jar, I was hit with the scent of herb garden greenery.  There was hardly a hint of the astringent lemon or diesel smells common of Sour Diesel.  Instead, there was an herbal tea aroma and a warm, pungent earth smell.  It was quite sweet and enjoyable, like a big bowl of mother nature.  The taste was imperceptible until the exhale.  Especially with the green hit, the smoke was sweet and organic.  There is little smoker’s fatigue, and the smoke is thin and vaporous.\n\nS.A.G.E.’s perfect equilibrium is ruined by the addition of Sour Diesel, making for a sativa to indica ratio of 3 to 1 in its genetics.  However, you will hardly feel like you have anything less than an improvement on your hands.  The high is expansive and dreamy.  There is a strong disembodiment and a disconnect from the world.  Highs like this are an experience all their own.  Slightly hallucinogenic at high doses, a blunt made me lose myself for hours at a time.  Sour Sage is a great daytime high, but save it for weekends.  It will help you escape your troubles, and any stress will simply recede.\n\nhttp://ocweedreview.wordpress.com/","strain":"sage-n-sour","user":"OCWeedReview","stars":"3.5","date":"2/7/2014 8:12 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Relaxed","Sage","Skunk","Diesel"],"ID":"126450"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"red-dragon","user":"lclement4","stars":"4","date":"2/7/2014 8:20 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Energetic","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Uplifted","Flowery","Spicy/Herbal","Woody"],"ID":"126451"},{"_type":"dict","content":"With its genetics I knew this medicine would be stinky but oh my- the smell left a trail wherever one went.

After enduring a month in frigid Chicago and getting to know the term polar vortex well, I’ve been spending as much time under the palm trees of SoCal as possible.  It isn’t the taste, but the spirit of this strain that makes me think of warm, sunny beaches and bathing suits.\n\nThese buds were lumpy and long and markedly sticky.  This is no surprise since an abundance of cloudy amber-colored late harvest trichromes can be seen across the nuggets.  Maui Waui is a ginger lady, and orange hairs stick out like cowlicks.  It wasn’t the look but the the scent of this strain that sold me in the dispensary.  Diving your nose into the jar grabs thick wafts of pine and lemon cleaner, similar to Chemdawg strains, but sweet like Super Lemon Haze.  There is also a minimal baking spice aroma as well that comes through in a big way in the aftertaste.  The smoke is thin and not expansive, making medicating a pleasurable after thought.  I love a flavorful strain, and this is as fragrant and tasty as they come.\n\nPopular among the hippy crowds in California during the late sixties, Maui Waui was an early high THC plant, desired for its potency and uplifting sativa high.  I place it in a category of what I like to call brain strains: sativas so erudite and sophisticated that they make you more capable.  I love to work on strains like this, since they pique your creativity, expand your imagination, and enhance your problem solving.  With no noticeable indica effects, strains like Maui Waui will drive your productivity and are exceptional daytime, mid-week highs.  However, it is just as appropriate a medication for your times of repose.\n\nhttp://ocweedreview.wordpress.com/","strain":"maui-wowie","user":"OCWeedReview","stars":"4","date":"2/9/2014 2:25 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Focused","Talkative","Lemon","Ammonia","Pine"],"ID":"126601"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Really nice strain, smelled pretty good too!

Took about 2 months for the milky trichomes to begin turning amber. Flushed it for about 1 week. Cured the crop for another week before sampling. Rolled a joint, took 2 hits, wife took one. Smell and taste was nothing special. As for the effect... WOW! It hits fast... took less than 5 minutes... yup, this is powerful stuff. I had a mild headache/migraine all day and that just disappeared. What is strange is that it's a strong buzz but it's nothing wild... there are no visuals, nothing psychedelic... sounds and colours didn't appear any different than before the hit... no time distortion. We never felt out of control... no hint of panic, no paranoia, no increased heart rate and no anxiety. What I really enjoyed was it's clear-headed buzz. We just felt really happy, talkative, kind, empathetic, playful... This stuff takes you to a warm, fuzzy place and keeps you there for quite some time. The come-down is amazing too... didn't feel exhausted at all, just really relaxed. Overall, this is a great stress reliever which doesn't knock you out. Body-wise... your muscles relax and you feel a slight vibration going through your body... it's quite nice. However, we didn't really feel any increased sexual arousal like others report (was hoping for this). Also, not as indica as I thought it would be... I'd call it energy-neutral... didn't suck the life out of us. Made us a little dizzy for the first 30 minutes (don't drive on this right after smoking). After the dizziness goes away... your mind is left in the most wonderful place. The munchies then set in... we became obsessed by the thought of food. I think I understand this strain... this is not Viagra... but it probably makes sex (or anything else pleasurable) a lot more enjoyable, be it food, sex or any other activity. Hint: Prepare your favourite (healthy) foods before smoking... otherwise, you'll be munching on chips, kid cereals or any other crap you can dig up. Overall, highly recommended... maybe our new favourite.","strain":"atomic-northern-lights","user":"Deetom","stars":"4.5","date":"2/8/2014 3:49 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Hungry","Relaxed","Happy","Uplifted","Talkative","Energetic","Dizzy","Spicy/Herbal","Woody"],"ID":"126617"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"KilllahB","stars":"5","date":"2/8/2014 4:08 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Flowery","Pungent","Skunk","Diesel"],"ID":"126618"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Smooth smoke, had a clean taste.

I'm very happy I got to try this delicious strain, as this is another wonderful Indica that I have gotten my hands on. The buds of this plant look fairly similar to OG Kush; light green with orange pistils, and a nice coat of sparkly trichomes. The aroma is subtle and nice; a light mix of citrus, spicy, and skunky smells, and upon breaking the buds is a nice, crisp pine aroma. The taste is not too much to boast about, a typical cannabis taste, not very distinctive. But the wonderful effects more than make up for the boring taste. This strain first affects your mind, giving you a calm and happy euphoria that is almost Sativa-like, but without being to racy, and instead leaves you quite focused. Then the body high creeps up, perfectly complimenting the head high, and gives you a great tingly body vibration that quickly eases aches and pains. For me this is a fantastic strain and is very useful, as it's mental effects are just right, putting me in a happy and content state of mind while not being too Sativa-like, whereas the body high is a very pleasant and relaxing body stone, while still being able to move around, and even exercise. All in all, I completely recommend this strain! Great for body pains, headaches, fatigue, and definitely stress and anxiety. Perfect for the evening, and even the morning, especially when paired with some good coffee. Absolutely a new favorite Indica of mine :)","strain":"pure-kush","user":"travitoninja99","stars":"5","date":"2/9/2014 6:23 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Relaxed","Happy","Tingly","Uplifted","Focused","Dry Mouth","Spicy/Herbal","Pine","Pungent","Citrus"],"ID":"126692"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"vanilla-kush","user":"vclemmons","stars":"4","date":"2/9/2014 6:25 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Relaxed","Sleepy","Dry Mouth","Dry Eyes","Vanilla","Lavender"],"ID":"126693"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"bubba-kush","user":"vclemmons","stars":"4.5","date":"2/9/2014 6:32 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"126694"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"headband","user":"solarsammy","stars":"4","date":"2/9/2014 6:35 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Giggly","Talkative","Euphoric"],"ID":"126695"},{"_type":"dict","content":"literally the best I've ever smoked.

You should wait till she is all the way done before harvest...Its soo worth it! with a great uplifting buzz that might make you giggle with joy! she has a earthy taste that is smooth and refreshing. I will grow this again and again. here is what Attitude seed bank had to say: Barneys Farm Laughing Buddha were developed by the Barney's Farm's seed breeders by crossing Thai and Jamaican marijuana genotypes. This new strain is mostly sativa, with very fruity, exotic flavours and an intense sativa high. In 2003, she won the Cannabis High Cup and became an undoubed favourite in marijuana smoking society. Laughing Buddha are stable and show consistent results with at least 80% germination. They are suitable for indoor and outdoor cultivation, show typical sativa growing characteristics and develop tall straight plants with a rich branching system and plenty of bud sites. Plants of this cannabis variety grow fast and stretch during flowering and a bit of training might be required, some prefer pruning or bending over and tying down (very effective), some go for tipping the tops - anything will do. When growing outside, Laughing Buddha can become as tall as 2-2.5 m(6 to 8 feet). high, indoor samples remain their decent size of about 130 cm(4 to 5 feet). Those weed lovers who prefer to grow Laughing Buddha outside start harvesting in mid October (Northern Hamisphers) with a naturally high yield of app. 450 gr. per plant. Like any other sativa dominant marijuana strain, Laughing Buddha has a longer flowering period than her indica counterpartner, it takes 11 weeks for her to fully mature, some cannabis growers give her another week or two to get the best results. A very distinct, powerful sweet and spicy aroma appears at the beginning of flowering. Grown up plants display long fat colas, virtually dripping with resinous trichomes. Laughing Buddha marijuana is said to contain as much as 18% of THC and 0.4% of CBD what makes her high very energizing and happy giggling.","strain":"laughing-buddha","user":"FukNLuv420","stars":"4.5","date":"2/9/2014 6:28 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Giggly","Energetic","Happy","Creative","Uplifted","Grapefruit","Lemon","Blueberry","Pineapple","Mango","Pear","Peach","Violet","Earthy","Sweet","Skunk","Tea","Coffee","Vanilla","Sage"],"ID":"126719"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This strain has a mike Tyson type blow ..

Its incredibly intense lemony flavour, with a strong haze background has a sharp and intense taste, which reminds of lemon, lime and pink grapefruit, followed by a very earthy and musky haze aftertaste, with traces of incense and black pepper. The effect is very balanced; it starts with a quick indica-hit feeling that softly moves to a very strong high, with a social and creative side. The Super Lemon Haze is a very smooth compromise between the great qualities of its parents. It's cannabis seeds has 9-10 weeks flowering time, and a very typical Christmas tree shape. Plants tend to grow quite tall, but the internodes are not too far apart, and allow easy topping. The leaves are very sativa-like, while bud formation comes dense and has a high calyx-to-leaf ratio. The Super Lemon Haze is very effective both indoors and outdoors, and responds very well to high-EC hydro systems as well as organic soil setups. When cultivated in soil, the spectrum of terpens is more developed and gives an extra lemony flavour. The THC is high at over 22%, ensuring a very psychedelic experience to even the most experienced smokers. Effect: A very lemony haze, works fast and lasts long. It’s a very powerful high, very balanced between a physical and a cerebral side. Flowering outdoor: finishes end October in northern hemisphere, production up to 1000 gr/plant.","strain":"super-lemon-haze","user":"FukNLuv420","stars":"5","date":"2/9/2014 6:57 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Uplifted","Sweet","Lemon","Skunk","Sage"],"ID":"126837"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I got to a solid (10) with this stuff, I had small hallucinations, but nothing to out of the park. it was crazy","strain":"tangerine-kush","user":"kartertritschler","stars":"5","date":"2/9/2014 8:40 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Giggly","Happy","Relaxed","Sleepy","Tingly","Sweet","Citrus","Lemon"],"ID":"126839"},{"_type":"dict","content":"headband is the best ^_^ love it. definitely tasting earthy mixed with diesel. easy on the lungs. head and body high comes on quick. great anytime of the day. five stars.","strain":"headband","user":"Dankapotimus","stars":"5","date":"2/9/2014 9:19 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Creative","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Relaxed","Tingly","Uplifted","Earthy","Tea","Diesel"],"ID":"126840"},{"_type":"dict","content":"SMOOTH!!! nice cherry taste, wonderful strain for a hybrid... in my top 5 of all time!   natures az is where I get it,","strain":"cherry-kush","user":"db6","stars":"4","date":"2/9/2014 9:21 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Euphoric","Sleepy","Hungry","Berry","Spicy/Herbal","Tea"],"ID":"126841"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Headaches after a few joints.

The taste highlights almost dirt-like earthiness, folowed by a sweet pine aftertaste.\n\nDespite being a heavy indica fanatic, the Ghost OG gives an energetic, but still stony alternative.","strain":"ghost-og","user":"mklodt","stars":"3.5","date":"2/11/2014 5:32 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Energetic","Happy","Talkative","Creative","Citrus","Orange","Lime","Pine","Earthy","Cheese","Butter","Mint","Coffee","Sweet"],"ID":"127257"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"alaskan-thunder-fuck","user":"youngod3ss","stars":"5","date":"2/11/2014 5:38 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"127258"},{"_type":"dict","content":"to baked to comment. 5/5 bitches ","strain":"blue-dream","user":"patberg","stars":"5","date":"2/11/2014 6:34 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Giggly","Happy","Relaxed","Sleepy","Tingly","Uplifted","Sweet","Berry"],"ID":"127259"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"ogre","user":"wetty23","stars":"4","date":"2/11/2014 8:16 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Focused","Giggly","Happy","Relaxed","Talkative","Uplifted","Citrus","Earthy","Woody"],"ID":"127260"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"green-queen","user":"bizcochito","stars":"5","date":"2/11/2014 8:55 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy"],"ID":"127261"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"lsd","user":"bizcochito","stars":"5","date":"2/11/2014 8:58 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Sleepy","Relaxed","Hungry"],"ID":"127262"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Long buzz (head and body), very smooth smoke and taste, dense sticky buds, very frosty!

Incredibly strong , succulent and bold. A great sativa that can allow you to get things done. Strongly recommended for someone with headaches, migraines, overall fatigue and lack of focus. Some days you just can't concentrate, and some days you feel slow moving.This is a great plant for creativity as well as increasing deep thought focus and energy. This flower, allows you to have spontaneous energy-but without the stress compared with too many cups of coffee . Its completely mellow yet you could multitask several projects and not feel overwhelmed with jitters or anxiety that you sometimes can get from other potent sativas. Great for mornings -although be careful. It may seem after a few hits that nothing is happening.. this can be a slow starting sativa.

UW has been doing some great research on marijuana and its effects, and has done so for a long time now.

Looks beautiful, impressive even.. I definitely suggest you try this when you have a chance. I enjoy this strain quite a bit. Also some background, ive been enjoying the benefits of marijuana for 20+yrs. Been consuming a couple g's daily for many years. I feel sometimes this info is important in a review to gauge where someone is coming from. People with lower tolerances and those who can still get the effects off 2-3 pulls will probably find this strain amazing. Its not always just about THC content, the effects it creates are also really important. Really a nice impressive  buzz that is worth noting. Dont miss out on this, specially as a connoisseur ;).","strain":"g-13","user":"Redone","stars":"3.5","date":"2/16/2014 10:08 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Relaxed","Uplifted","Happy"],"ID":"128999"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Ha, i got used to this strain, im a stress and anxiety guy and i didnt have any issues with this, i cant say i notice it helped, but it definitely did not cause any problems for me, Ive had this too much though and dont enjoy it anymore. I think its just because thats all i had for months and months. Some would say i was lucky, but i like to switch it up and get bored easy, its like if you have pork chops every day for 6 months, youll start to dislike pork chops. Specially when there is such a large selection out there. One of the better strains ive tried on the sativa side though and i think ill try it again someday. I recommend it to people who have never had it who enjoy sativas, and specially a first time sativa smoker. It will show you what they are about without giving you the extreme side of the spectrum.","strain":"jack-herer","user":"Redone","stars":"2.5","date":"2/16/2014 10:44 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Focused","Energetic","Uplifted","Talkative","Creative","Happy"],"ID":"129000"},{"_type":"dict","content":"We sell  quality Marijuana and herbal incense in both large and small quantities.below is a list of some of our products\n\nTEXT US DIRECTLY AT .....(201)-777-1767\n\ncontact us at (bathdepot87@gmail.com)\n\nIn Stoke...\n \n \nOrange Krush,\nBlueberry bud,\nDutch Haze herbal smoke\npurple kush\no.g kush\nbubble gum\njamican gold\narabian solid smoke\nhoney blonde\ndream smoke\nskunk\npanama gold\nkanzak smoke\nisland smoke\nMystical Spirit Smoke\nKing Tut Herbal Smoking Blend\nWild Greens Herbal Smoke\nLeonurus Sibiricus\nSinicuichi (Sun Opener)\nWild Dagga (Leonotis leonurus)\nCalea Zacatechichi\nHawaiian Haze Legal Buds\nDutch Green Bud\nJamaican Gold Bud Legal Buds\nBlueberry Hybrid Legal Buds\nMaui Hybrid Buds\nHybrid Nuggets\nBlack Magic Herbal Solid Concentrate\nHoney Blonde Solid Concentrate\nArabian Brown Solid Concentrate\nDouble Apple Herbal Shisha\nWatermelon Herbal Shisha\nBlueberry Herbal Shisha\nPineapple Herbal Shisha\nPeach Herbal Shisha\nMixed Fruit Herbal Shisha\nHerbal Shisha Combo\nBubble Gum Kush Legal Bud\nDutch Green Bud\nJamaican Gold Bud\nBlueberry Herbal Hybrid Buds\nMaui Hybrid Buds\nHybrid Nuggets\n\n\n-We offer discreet and Relaible packaging and delivery.\n-Fast and reliable shipment within 48 hours, using courier service, DHL, EMS,\nFEDEX\n\nTEXT US DIRECTLY AT .....(201)-777-1767\n\ncontact us at (bathdepot87@gmail.com)","strain":"white-widow","user":"doctorchem8","stars":"3.5","date":"2/16/2014 1:01 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Relaxed","Hungry"],"ID":"129001"},{"_type":"dict","content":"tastes and smells so sweet just like a mango","strain":"mango-kush","user":"snoopy904","stars":"4","date":"2/15/2014 5:04 AM","attributes":["Topical ","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Uplifted","Mango"],"ID":"129002"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Great Strain.

The thug behind the counter eyed me with an empty gaze as I walked through the door and barked over to me, \"what do you need?\". I was quite startled and simply asked for some medicine to ease my pain and discomfort. He looked over his wares momentarily and procured a brown bag marked \"white widow\". I hesitated momentarily then purchased my medicine. As I entered my vehicle I noticed a strange odor emanating from the paper bag. The scented resembled what I can only describe as a mix between vomit and freshly deceased skunk. I shrugged and went on my way. Back at home, I rolled a large \"joint\" of white widow and proceeded to take 3 large puffs. As I exhaled the third puff I began coughing, which only accentuated my crippling pain. After the coughing fit came to an end after what seemed an eternity, I was left with a strange spinning sensation in my abdomen and lower spinal column. \"How peculiar\", I remarked as I extinguished the burning cigarette. Not thirty minutes later, I found myself calling everyone who had written their numbers in my old highschool year book. No one answered, but I still felt the need to chat. I phoned my wife who was away on a business trip and explained that my medicine was giving me strange paranoia and that my mouth felt so dry, it was almost as if i had been chewing on cotton balls for the past hour. She laughed and hung up the phone.

Life sucks now because your plan of hooking up with any hot chick is crumbling to nothing. But then wait! That boring unattractive girl is sitting right across from you with a drink in her hand; looking weirdly around the room. You talk to her and then ten minutes later, you find out you like the same band and other crap. Things go great and you end up at her place. \"Well that escalated quickly\" is what you're gonna think but let's just give you the benefit of the doubt and your charm was 100% spot on. Then you realise that this girl who seemed so undesirable on the outside was actually super cool and sexy on in the inside. You no longer see her as what she portrays to the outside world but you love her for she really is. That's how I feel about sour Apple. It is like the underdog among other preferred hybrids but really it blows your mind and other psychedelic jibberish.

I guess that would be a great thing for people (like myself) who suffer from anxiety or have ADD.  It is a great meditative and reflective type of weed that has helped me see though many stressful circumstances. \n\nI also notice it is quite powerful in relieving pain.  I have some onset symptons of arthritis from playing the guitar and have noticed this helps alievieate some minor inflamation and various other painful symptoms.  \n\nKosher is also great for inducing a nice healthy appetite, not one of the ravenous types of \"munchies\" where you eat everything in the fridge and even start contemplating what lies in the dogs dish. \n\nNow that I think of it, it has helped me with nausea during the flu and as well as some minor sports injuries and migraines.\n\nI would try to describe the taste, but that always varies on the grower -- Mine is usually a thick pungent smoke  that has an earthy-sour-spicey-diesel taste to it. \n\nOverall, I rate this strain a solid 5 stars.  \nIf I were to ever be able to grow some personal medicinal plants, Kosher Kush would be one of the first seeds I would buy.","strain":"kosher-kush","user":"Audio_Geek","stars":"5","date":"2/22/2014 9:19 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Giggly","Happy","Relaxed","Creative","Uplifted","Earthy","Pungent","Pine","Diesel","Spicy/Herbal"],"ID":"130044"},{"_type":"dict","content":"arf arf grrrrr ruff ruff big dawg smoking","strain":"chemdawg","user":"LOUDOLOGIST","stars":"0","date":"2/23/2014 12:23 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"130046"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This is a beautiful strain.

This is a bud that one could smoke during the day and continue to operate consistently. The high is not overpowering or hallucinogenic. That being said, it is still enough to relieve pain and stop anxiety, telling me that this bud has almost perfect ratio of CBD - THC and can be widely applied to a variety of symptoms.

One of the most fantastic strains ive ever had the pleasure of reviewing. This is one that may be too strong for the novice and should only really be taken when one is going to be sitting for a long period. This produces some hallucinations and severe couch lock. Awesome for insomnia and anxiety! You will get severe munchies. This strain can make you feel a little higher than other strains will. Although some may find this a little too potent, i find the high perfectly puts my mind at ease and reduces my anxiety and helps insomnia. The flavor and smell is very mild and smelling and looking at the bud you might not expect the potency. The taste is sort of unique. A very subtle kushy flavor underlines the richer herbally and quite good piney flavor. This is complimented by a beautiful array of citrus flavors that will dance on your tongue to finish. The flavor is hard to describe but quite good. The effects leave you in couch lock, great for a nighttime medication. God x Zed is one of the best strains i have ever had.

Then all of a sudden it seemed like everyone in their mother were talking about it! I had to do some research and let me tell you, it only intensified my desire to try it. So many different, exciting strains all packed into one beautiful plant. This week I finally got a chance to try it! The person I got it from won a cannabis cup (or whatever its called) for his GSC so I was definitely on board. I picked up and eighth and rushed home. The buds didn't look impressive in the dim car light, however when I took them in the house and put them under some light, it was like seeing the Mona Lisa for the first time. Vibrant lime green and rich purple leaves were garnished with lovely reddish orange hairs. Talk about bag appeal. The buds alone could have been a center piece! The smell alone deserves it own review but thats for another time. The smell was so indescribably strong and out of this world, difficult to pinpoint. 4 Grams permeated every inch of my full size SUV. And that was even after keeping it in a baggie and in the glovebox. Now to the smoking experience. Usually i use a grinder but these buds were SO DAMN sticky! It was like they had been dipped in glue or something. I decided to ditch the grinder and break it down by hand. And boy was it dense. A small .3 gram nug yielded three decent bowls. I barely touched the flame to the bowl and the bong immediately filled up with thick, rich, flavorful smoke that was surprisingly not very harsh at all. Before I could even exhale I could already feel it. My body became immediately relaxed, pain from my gastrointestinal problems were non-exist and my body had a pleasant warm tingly sensation that made it feel like every molecule in my body was being massaged. Then I exhaled. As the smoke, that somehow seemed thicker now, left my lungs and mouth, my mind went with it in the best way possible. All of the anxiety and depression I experience was washed away like a wave returning to the ocean. The high was nothing short of euphoria. Im usually a quiet reserved person but I found myself singing, even dancing a little, laughing a lot and just having the absolute best time of my life. No words can do this justice. The best part is I only needed about a third of the amount I usually smoke to get medicated. The strain didn't have a dramatic or unpleasant comedown and it didn't force me go to sleep. Instead made me feel increasingly more relaxed and calm and at peace to where i got to the point where lying on my bed felt like relaxing on a cloud wrapped in a goose down blanket. Eventually I drifted off to a DEEP, peaceful sleep, allowing me to wake up feeling energized but not anxious and also very happy. If you come across this strain, DO NOT PASS IT UP!","strain":"girl-scout-cookie","user":"Cookiemonster777","stars":"5","date":"2/26/2014 5:06 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Relaxed","Giggly","Happy","Aroused","Uplifted","Talkative","Hungry","Dry Mouth","Earthy","Pungent","Skunk","Diesel","Mint","Grape","Pepper"],"ID":"130870"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"thebigG0705","stars":"5","date":"2/26/2014 6:16 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Relaxed","Happy","Talkative","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"130871"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-cheese","user":"thebigG0705","stars":"4","date":"2/26/2014 6:25 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Energetic","Talkative","Dry Mouth","Blue Cheese"],"ID":"130872"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"trainwreck","user":"thebigG0705","stars":"4","date":"2/26/2014 6:27 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Sleepy","Happy","Talkative","Earthy"],"ID":"130873"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"ak-47","user":"mayfly","stars":"2","date":"2/26/2014 7:19 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"130874"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"durban-poison","user":"mayfly","stars":"3","date":"2/26/2014 7:22 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"130875"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"268b38c7-1b5a-4714-9362-2a16ade38729","user":"OmHealingCaregivers","stars":"5","date":"2/26/2014 7:36 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Euphoric","Happy","Relaxed"],"ID":"130876"},{"_type":"dict","content":"really has helped with my anxiety disorder!

It hits you quite quickly and continues to strengthen and build up for longer than most other flowers i have tried. Throughout the whole experience you get a great sense of tiredness. This is great before you go to bed! This strain will produce intense euphoria but quite different from most other strains.

It also made me feel incredibly sleepy and while sleeping I had a sensation of feeling my head pulse and pound from my migraine for a bit while in a semi conscious state.

I am not from this area and haven't smoked in over 7 years. I am a normal individual working a well paying job, but I have serious stress and anxiety issues that I refuse to go get drugs from the doctors, so before I went back to my state I decided to give  it a shot. I told the budtender what I needed (Something that is energetic and has stress relief) he gave me the Golden Goat (I'm like wtf is a golden goat..)I rolled up a joint and decided to walk to find a bus stop. Before I knew It I was jamming to some Father John Misty radio with my Hotel programmed into my GPS. I ended up walking about 4.5 miles back to my hotel in the snow and never felt more uplifted and stress free. I came back and dove right into some snacks.(Man food never tasted so good) After about 2 hours the feeling was wearing off, but yet... I felt normal.. a normal I have never felt before. No stress, no worries. I jumped on my laptop and knocked some work out... then I got bored and went back out and smoked some more. I smoked another joint.. ended up walking in the snow some more and was noticing the slightest of details in things. It has now been about 3 hours since I last smoked and I feel no high except.. my stress is gone and my body is relaxed. Still fully functional.. ? No dry mouth.. no headache.. I rolled up in some \"organic hemp\" rolling paper and there was no burn in the throat. It was cold and I had to keep hitting it to see if I was actually inhaling because I thought my breathe was smoke. Nope..I was inhaling it just didn't hurt. Something must have changed in the weed over the years, or this is just what real weed is about. Why is this illegal again?I just rolled my last joint and what might be the last joint for several years to go come. I'm hoping that this can become legal on the east coast, so I can become a functional person without all the stress and anxiety.. I'd love to see the world with these glasses on everyday.. its so beautiful. I'll pass on the Benzos.. and SSRIs.. I'm smiling when I write this because it's so beautiful and sad at the same time that I cannot participate... One love my friends and keep this going. Spread the word about this beautiful plant.

A cross between Purple Elephant and ChemDawg Sour Diesel. The bud is light green, orange hairs, with a thick covering of trichromes. It has the smell of grape candy and sour notes, the taste is very similar.\n\nThe indica is very apparent in the onset with a physical body and head buzz, which has an easy transition to intense cerebral, thought-provoking effects from the sativa.

The mind is still able to stick to a task, and frustration seems to be held back. I can't say though that I have much of a motivation to get up.\n\nI feel a little bit of physical anxiety, but it's relatively easy to concentrate on it and mentally release the tension. I have less motivation to exert a normal amount of energy. I'd think that once I get going, keeping momentum might not be too hard.","strain":"8e732148-abe1-40e2-8fca-e9009449f4be","user":"natan.wettstein","stars":"4","date":"3/3/2014 6:42 AM","attributes":["Concentrate ","Euphoric","Relaxed"],"ID":"132491"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I smoked some of this...Medical Sour Haze...

It's great for both recreational and medical purposes, a very versatile strain.

Not necessarily in a good way though, as the high was very intense, and depressing....It made you see things through a very cynical perspective (such as overly worrying about insecurities you have about your body, and making you feel very strongly about them.) Life/work problems feel like they are too overwhelming, and not worth the effort, and overall, you are left with a body high that feels closer to a helpless \"statue/paralyzed\" feeling, rather than a comfortable, buzzing melting/sedating/couchlock feeling.\n\nFinally after forcing myself to lay down and get a good amount of sleep, the \"hangover\" the next day is horrible. Very depressing, unmotivating, and upsetting.....Very close to the afterglow you get from unmentionables. \n\nI have tried several no-name & club strains with lab-tested thc percentages higher than the BK I got, so I'm sure it isn't just paranoia from high THC %'s.

Particularly versatile plant that gives really good results both indoors and outdoors. It is suitable to grow in spaces with limited height.

It makes dense buds compact and completely snowed giving very high performance. The scent of this plant reminiscent to pine and has an earthy flavor with hints of grape that is unmistakable. We recommend organic growing to maximize its aroma and flavor.  It has a high level of THC that gives a euphoric entry but quickly becomes a sensation rather narcotic, being valued at medicinal level for illness like depression, insomnia and pain relief. Its effect is strong and can lasts up to four hours in people with low tolerance levels, and is usually characterized by its relaxing effects.","strain":"special-kush-1","user":"Jayszx","stars":"0.5","date":"3/5/2014 3:39 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Relaxed","Creative","Uplifted","Hungry","Dry Mouth","Grape","Pine","Earthy"],"ID":"132972"},{"_type":"dict","content":"First thing I ever smoked.

I am more prone to anxiety attacks and paranoia than most patients, and certain strains will set me off, whether I'm alone or with people. I did not experience any negative side effects from Dairy Queen. \n\nThis is great for my IBS. I usually end up sitting with my hands on my belly waiting for the bubbling, stabbing pains and swelling to stop when my IBS flares up. Minutes after a dose of Dairy Queen, however, and I was fine. I felt some bubbling (which are actually spasms I think) as usual, but they were weaker, and nothing followed. This strain left me relaxed, euphoric yet clear-headed (at first) and quieted all of the racing thoughts in my mind. I have a lot of noise going on at all times (do we all?).

Sour Candy Apple has dark leaves and light emerald flowers, flush with pale hairs.  There is a fruit scent similar to an apple or pear.  It’s a bit piney also, but barely so.  The buds I got were really fresh, making them hard to break up.  Once they dried after a moment or two on a dish, they were much more workable.  Smoking it gives a really harsh hit, but the exhale is all fresh apple and slightly sour.  It isn’t overwhelming like a sour patch kid, though.  More subtle.  More bearable.\n\nSour Apple is a mix of a heavy Kush indica and Sour Diesel.  I’m not sure where the “Candy” in the name comes from, but the obvious choice would be a work in of Candy Kush.  The high left me with a nice warm tingle in body, like a warm spiced wine enjoyed in front of a fire.  It was heavy in the eyes and comfortingly sleepy, a kind of drunk feeling.  I was still able to function on lower doses, and it was mellow and smooth.  I found it to be a great wake and bake strain on a weekend, when you want the dreaminess of morning to continue.  However, it is a bit too distracting for a work day.  The more I smoked, the more couch-locked I got.  When used late enough, it put me down swiftly to sleep.  This hybrid seems to swing far to the indica side, making it perfect for all kinds of pain relief and insomnia.  \n\nhttp://ocweedreview.wordpress.com/","strain":"sour-apple","user":"OCWeedReview","stars":"3.5","date":"3/9/2014 8:56 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Euphoric","Apple","Pear","Chemical","Sweet"],"ID":"134675"},{"_type":"dict","content":"When I was in my graduate program we used to drink a shot called the Lemon Drop.  Vodka was shaken over ice and then strained.  The shots were chased by biting on a sugared lemon.  I used to love them.  Citrusy sweet, and slightly sour.  While browsing through OCPC’s waxes this week, I was looking for something more glassy.  I’ve just had a real dry Blue Dream wax that was troubling to use in my pen, so I was looking for something that would vaporize easier.  However, hidden behind a stack of darker budders, I saw this golden gram of Lemon Drop wax and decided to take it home.  I’m a sucker for the Limonene terpene that gives some strains their lemony flavor, and I was hoping to get a big dose with this donation.\n\nThis Lemon Drop wax melted well in my Cloud Pen, if not a bit slow.  I had to make sure to get it right down on the heating coil to get a full hit.  Although it was wetter than some waxes, I still ended with crumbles in my Oil Slick jar when breaking pieces off the rather sizeable 1g moonstone I picked out.  Like clay from a cave, it was pliable but grainy.  Having a light brown color, it wasn’t the purest of waxes I’ve seen, but it was clearly free of most particulates.\n\nThere was a nice and sweet lemon scent, similar to Super Lemon Haze, but less aromatic than a well cured flower.  The vapor is thin, and so is the taste, both of which were a disappointment.  However, it hits heavy to the cheeks and forehead when it does finally heat up enough to vape well.  I had lazy, drooping eyes that made me look higher than I was.  Lemon Drop was actually quite clear headed and creative in low doses.  But giggly and euphoric during longer sessions.  The medication seems to lean sativa, but it is clearly a sativa/indica hybrid.  It offered a two part high.  While there was good tension relief in the head and neck and I found it effective for migraines, Lemon drop also worked well for stress and anxiety relief.  The relaxing of both the mind and body is perfect to make it through your tougher days at the office.\n\nhttp://ocweedreview.wordpress.com/","strain":"lemon-drop","user":"OCWeedReview","stars":"3","date":"3/9/2014 8:59 PM","attributes":["Concentrate ","Giggly","Euphoric","Happy","Creative","Talkative","Lemon","Sweet"],"ID":"134676"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"shaman","user":"left","stars":"3","date":"3/9/2014 9:30 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Focused","Talkative","Uplifted","Paranoid"],"ID":"134677"},{"_type":"dict","content":"very nice blend I was high instantly:-) :-)\n\n","strain":"girl-scout-cookie","user":"ogtopdog","stars":"5","date":"3/9/2014 10:03 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Talkative","Sweet","Citrus","Grapefruit","Tropical","Spicy/Herbal","Minty"],"ID":"134678"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Dense.

Seriously. It's just awesome all across the board. And although I'm no Cannabis connoisseur, this strain's effect has everything I look for, and almost nothing that I don't.\n\nProbably the most present side-effect is dry mouth, but that's to be expected. Dry eyes also follows, but to a lesser degree. However, I already have evaporative dry-eye to begin with. The last negative is that it's not so great when it's time for bed and you're still really high. It's awesome to smoke with friends when you're all hanging out at night time, but when it's time to hit the sack, you may have a hard time falling asleep if you're still too baked. If that's the case, you'll feel too mentally stimulated to really relax and fall asleep.\n\nThe positives: Basically everything. Being a potent, pure Sativa, its wonderful cerebral effects kick in fast, but in stages. The first time I tried it, I hit it way too hard and frequently. It was the highest I had ever been on a Sativa, and it was so intense that it made me trip when I closed my eyes. Amazing sensations of connectedness and bursts of colorful energy. That was only once though. Normally, you'll feel great, stimulated, happy, uplifted, euphoric, sociable, connected, all that great stuff.\n\nThen there's the effect change. This gradient doesn't follow that of a typical hybrid strain. Those will generally start off laughy and cerebral, and end with the sleepy Indica part of it. Which, depending on the strains and their ratio, can be a great, well-rounded high. Sour Diesel, however, tapers differently. The first noticeable difference is its unmistakeable dreamy phase. You'll still be plenty awake, but it feels very surreal and dreamlike. The third phase in this gradient is spaaaaaaaacey. It's at this point that I find myself fixated on something or staring off into space without the desire to say much or pay close attention to the words of others. That would require more mental energy/concentration than you want to spend at this point. In this way, the third phase is rather juxtaposed to the first one. You're just so incredibly content doing nothing and spacing out, that you may not want to be disturbed. It's like a trance state. My theory is that one experiences theta-wave patterns. This, then, gives way to a very relaxed feeling, which can actually make you go to bed earlier than usual if it's already late at night.\n\nOverall, it's amazing. But one still needs to exercise caution. As I said, you'll feel the buzz quickly, but the REAL high hits you hard in waves (usually one or two) after you're done smoking. Take controlled hits, and trust that it'll do its job. Believe me, it will!","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"FromElsewhere","stars":"4.5","date":"3/11/2014 1:47 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Energetic","Happy","Uplifted","Talkative","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"135128"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Wow.

I broke my nose when I was younger, and have always had bad sinus pressure as a result. This strain really helped with my headache, but it took me by total surprise. I smoke on a regular basis, and usually am very calm and collected. I also suffer from waves of severe depression and anxiety, and that causes me to lose my appetite. As I said, this strain helped my headache perfectly well. But my body is not in good health, being that I used to smoke cigarettes on a daily basis and have a horrible diet. This strain made my heart race uncomfortably fast, and tied with the INSANELY strong psychological effects, I did not enjoy it for about the first hour. I felt every knot and clot in my body, and began crying because of the bad health I was in. I reminded myself that it was the strain, and felt much better after eating toast and some cereal. \n\nNow the catch- i love this strain. I love strains that are so strong that you lose touch with yourself. I see it as a part of psychological healing, along with physical. I warn- do not use this strain if you are anxious about a current event or have a bad heart. Use it in smaller amounts during the day, and I suggest having someone else there if you are using it to treat depression. I did it alone, and wished I had someone to talk to the whole time. \n\nVery strong, sativa rush. Use in moderation, and very social high.","strain":"lemon-jack","user":"HamIcing","stars":"4.5","date":"3/13/2014 5:28 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Energetic","Paranoid","Anxious","Lemon"],"ID":"135792"},{"_type":"dict","content":"It a great smell to it that make it so amazing.

The Blackwater strain matures @ around 8 weeks give or take a few days providing there was no lock up due to environmental/nutritional instability. Blackwater is a slow growing low yielding strain when grown indoors. I have yet to experiment with it outdoors. The smoke is rich and smooth with an unmistakable berry like flavor and long lingering aroma. The potency is high. Be careful with your dosing as it comes on more slowly than most but lasts a formidable two plus hours with a very clean dismount. The effect is quite calming with a touch of thought provoked giggling in the middle. My most profound observation was the total lack of arthritic pain in my neck, wrists and knees that I normally experience on a daily basis. Overall a highly desireable medicinal strain.

This review is based off the last 12 hours of 'blazing' down on this. Will say, pre-smoke, that I was feeling really down, not in the mood for anything, and unable to think up ideas for my art. After smoking this, fifteen minutes rolled by (time till effect is varied by tolerance) and I immediately felt like getting up and going for a walk. Especially with the beautiful white scenery in this year's winter, the euphoria and extreme happiness/tingling from this strain gave a beautiful outlook to everything and promoted random but beautiful ideas. Immediate cure for a rough day/week/life. For users who want a tolerance suggestion; low-tol - I recommend trying a few weaker buds before hand so this strain doesn't 'slap' you in the face and possibly cause paranoia. For high-tol and especially people who can mentally handle very strong highs I say jump right in and try it.","strain":"white-widow","user":"dmt_xyz","stars":"4","date":"3/24/2014 7:00 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Happy","Talkative","Uplifted","Tingly","Earthy","Sage","Tea"],"ID":"139726"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Before you compare my review to someone else's, I am smoking home-grown, well cared for cannabis so the THC levels may be higher than most users.

Also P.S.A. have water standing by, and for users with a low-tolerance try and have a friend to smoke with (smoking with friends is better anyway) in case you begin to feel dizzy or paranoid/overwhelmed because like I noted before this is a very heavy indicate.

I wouldn't so much say that it hits you like a trainwreck, but it definitely does creep up on you after awhile. I'd say it takes 15/30 minutes before you realize you're high. Then, it only gets higher from there. I've found it hits me in stages. But, the feeling of relaxation starts about 15 minutes in. I feel it just wash over me in entirety, and it just makes me feel peaceful, happy, and relaxed. Perfect to come home to after a long or stressful day. For me, the smoke is quite smooth. I'm normally a cougher, as I have asthma, so I find smoking is pretty rough - not this. I'm able to take bigger, deeper hits, without coughing my brains out. I've noticed that it takes awhile to fully knock me out, aka get me to a sleep state. Probably within a couple hours? It does knock me out for a good 4 - 5 hours of sleep, where I'll be dead to the world. Haven't been able to sleep longer than that on it so far, regardless of how much I smoke of it. It doesn't make me super ravenously hungry, but I do crave certain foods about 45 minutes in. Something salty, or sweet usually. I normally smoke out of a water bong, filled with ice/cold water.

Anyway to sum it up this is definitely a great bud and taste wise and smell wise its a special 1 of a kind.

The flawless, uplifted, and encouraging high would likely make sex down right transcendent.\n\nSound is easily the best I've ever heard (second maybe to Pre-98 Bubba Kush?). Music is so fucking rich and textured, hitting at ever level tactfully and emotionally.\n\nOh my good, this is exactly what acid feels like. Visuals are incredibly delayed/augmented (in a beautifully investing way). Quite nearly hallucinating here...\n\nHaha, this is so fun! Mentally, TOTALLY GONE. Again, like acid, your head's in another place. Yet, there's a motivated energy that stays with you and keeps it uplifting. You will, unfortunately, get sleepy a little after halfway through. Not a negative crash, but a nap will sound SO GOOD.\n\nThis is your go-to high for shitty days. It's the equivalent of a loved one wrapping a big, warm blanket around you, erasing all your worries, and making you feel so happy and optimistic for the future. The kush element means it kicks ass for movies and music. Only downside is it can knock you out before you want it to - but that's indicas for ya.","strain":"og-kush","user":"weazal","stars":"4.5","date":"3/26/2014 6:24 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize"],"ID":"140842"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Awesome strain, without a doubt.\n\nGot a good high out of it, laughed a whole damn lot.\nGreat for couch surfing :)\n\nI sadly don't have anything \"In depth\" to say about this..

It was produced by caviar kings who is a company I have never heard of before. So, let's break into it and find out what caviar kings are all about. As flake goes it was a nice light creamy gold with a decent smell. I say decent because I could tell they had used a slightly lower quality butane to separate the hash from the buds by the slightest faint odor of sulfur. You almost can't smell it until someone points it out. Outside of the concentrate quality, which I would give a 4 out of 5, the high was pretty much what i expected from hash derived of a plant with 15% CBD and 5% THC. I was told this made the bho have a ratio of 75% CBD and 20ish% THC.  The high is pretty focused if any in the head and extremely relaxed in the body. All of my pain is gone after the first dab. However, even after dabs #2, 3 and 4 there is very little difference in my mood. No stoney feeling. No hazy feeling. Just zero pain. After about 45 minutes, a nice nap-time feeling comes on. However, this passes after 20 or so minutes and isn't as commanding as other \"sleepy\" highs. If that's the effect you desire then this girl is for you. As far as flavor goes I would score her at at 3.7 out of 5. Not bad sour and diesel flavor. There is a hint of tropical sweetness and that is what brings sativa fans back for more dabs.","strain":"sour-tsunami","user":"ElementalApothecary","stars":"3","date":"3/30/2014 9:20 PM","attributes":["Concentrate ","Relaxed","Focused","Tropical","Diesel","Earthy"],"ID":"142768"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"jillybean","user":"Oso2","stars":"5","date":"3/30/2014 10:12 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"142769"},{"_type":"dict","content":"An overall relaxing strain","strain":"og-kush","user":"SavageToker","stars":"0","date":"3/30/2014 10:15 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Hungry","Relaxed","Earthy","Woody"],"ID":"142770"},{"_type":"dict","content":"awesome woody taste, I'm bombed.","strain":"kryptonite","user":"kushkunsulant","stars":"4","date":"3/30/2014 10:57 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy","Sleepy","Uplifted","Woody","Pine","Spicy/Herbal"],"ID":"142771"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Out of my top 3 favorite strains as a heavy smoker, my number one has to be Granddaddy Purple.

The flavor is unique with a hint of blueberry and a blast of kush and skunk that finishes on a light lavender flavor after exhale. So, for science ...  i said for SCIENCE! ... lol i took another two dabs. Dab number two left the body even more relaxed and brought giggles to the head high. Not to mention more pleasure to the pallet with the light lavender finish. Dab number three brought some hammer down with a rockin body high and a focused, yet giggley, tunnel-visioned head high.

THAT's great, that we can hunt strains using Leafly's database. And this strain was recognizable in Flower, Wax and Oil. \n\nThe majority of \"up\" sativa cannabis can be so \"mental\" that it easily turns into anxiety and thought-shuffling confusion. Sour Diesel, instead, is comforting. It's also distinctly different from a lot of popular cannabis in that it has a bodily energy built-in. It IS energizing, and not in a silly giggly sort of way. You can focus almost as much as you want/need to, while the senses are expanded. Some (insightful) thought patterns have surprised me, a smidge of psychedelia. Fun with friends. \n\nYet it's got insulation qualities so you can allow your attention to drift, and good muscle relaxation, again not in a typical, sedating way. In fact the energy drive is hard to turn off. Not knowing the source, I might have suspected \"lacing\". I managed to get a lot done that day - definitely energized. A little THC flutter at higher levels, took a little effort to stay on track. And not recommended at bedtime. Since it didn't knock me off my feet, it first seemed a bit weak, but after a moment, big slow waves of different effects were coming my way.\n\nThe most surprising thing was how much my sciatica (lower back pinched nerves) pain improved. Not by distraction, as with many sativas, but by something more like a super-indica \"real analgesic\" effect from the waist down. I was able to walk twice as long as normally, and this effect persisted for hours, longer than expected, even a trace into the next morning. Synergizes well with my Rx pain meds.  I'm guessing that this is a specific effect that won't work for everyone. If you're one of the sensitive-to-SD patients with lower back problems, you'll be rewarded ;-)\n\nThis is definitely a fascinating one to check out, and a good \"tool\" strain, as opposed to a \"state\" strain. It's easy to understand why the Diesel derivs are so popular. I suspect it can be a day-long regular for many.","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"Fernand","stars":"5","date":"4/2/2014 7:33 AM","attributes":["Concentrate ","Creative","Energetic","Focused","Happy","Talkative","Uplifted"],"ID":"143376"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Boo, loses a half mark from me for being a spray on substance.

There's a pungent and pleasant odor that turns into a wonderful near hash-like taste when smoked. For such a wonderful taste and incredible high, there isn't too much stank to wreak havoc on your unfriendly neighbors. Aside from that plus and getting back to the high, it's simply delightful. It's not a creeping high, nor a high that came at you like raptors attacking from the sides. The high starts with a mild sativa-like cerebral effect, and then over the course of 10-15 minutes it changes to the deep body high due to it's dominant Indica heritage. This strains effects last quite a while on just a small amount, courtesy of the 30%+ THCA content which converts to THC when burned. If you smoke too much of this strain at once you WILL be prone to some negative side effects, so please use this medicine wisely and responsibly ! Also, the buzz from this strain will end in the very traditional sleepy Indica style. Medicating during the day will put you in line for caffeine later on or you may have an unscheduled nap in your day.

There's a pungent and pleasant odor that turns into a wonderful near hash-like taste when smoked. For such a wonderful taste and incredible high, there isn't too much stank to wreak havoc on your unfriendly neighbors. Aside from that plus and getting back to the high, it's simply delightful. It's not a creeping high, nor a high that came at you like raptors attacking from the sides. The high starts with a mild sativa-like cerebral effect, and then over the course of 10-15 minutes it changes to the deep body high due to it's dominant Indica heritage. This strains effects last quite a while on just a small amount, courtesy of the 30%+ THCA content which converts to THC when burned. If you smoke too much of this strain at once you WILL be prone to some negative side effects, so please use this medicine wisely and responsibly ! Also, the buzz from this strain will end in the very traditional sleepy Indica style. Medicating during the day will put you in line for caffeine later on or you may have an unscheduled nap in your day. Regardless of the potential user error, this strain is exceptional when consumed properly and is definitely a personal top 10.

It was Amazing. i had no ill effects towards light / sound nor tremors or other side effects i commonly get  with a migraine. My tinnitus was not effected positively or negatively. however, i wasn't thinking about it either. i will take another dose with that in mind and note if it aids at all. i have bilateral tinnitus and significant hearing loss from gun fire and explosions so if it is noticeable i will note it here. any relief that we can find is better than none, especially if its from a holistic background. \n\nI did not notice a body high nor any effects of the medicine in general, as i would from Queen Kush extract however, my tolerance levels are pretty high. for a new patient, i can't vouch for receiving or not receiving a high. if you do, it would be negligible. The medicinal properties of this plant have earned its way to the top of my go to meds for emergency migraine situations. Two patients with severe anxiety and Attention deficit issues noticed a significant overall happiness and calmness about themselves. \n\nMy anxiety levels are severely decreased when they are being Thunder Fucked. I find myself more calm and apt to handle any situation that arises with a more focused and clear view on all the factors at play,          (With less un-needed emotions) thus rendering a safe, positive and constructive outcome for all parties involved.\n\nIf you are suffering from Anxiety, Headaches, ADHD, PTSD, Chronic Migraines: I suggest this strain to experiment with. \n\nSmoking from flower:\n\nPretty sticky, it was an awesome Sativa. very piney almost citric to the taste and smell.  It didn't leave me couch locked, yet comfortably high. was more apt to stay on focus with this yet it did as usual with Sativa's and me, made me talkative. I would rate this for smoking on a 1-5 a 4. on the medicinal side. extracting the properties and transferring using coconut oil, for migraine specific seekers. i would rate this a 5 out of 5 medicinally.","strain":"alaskan-thunder-fuck","user":"medicine_man","stars":"4","date":"4/7/2014 4:19 AM","attributes":["Concentrate ","Creative","Energetic","Focused","Relaxed","Talkative","Uplifted","Pine","Citrus"],"ID":"144626"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"silver-haze","user":"myakeen","stars":"5","date":"4/7/2014 2:26 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Talkative","Tingly","Uplifted"],"ID":"144650"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"hindu-kush","user":"Daniboyy00Greencrackk","stars":"5","date":"4/7/2014 2:49 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"144651"},{"_type":"dict","content":"first time ive smoked, and it was amazing with this stuff. so good. ver yvery very dry mouth though. all other weed ive had gives me anxiety, but oh my i was so happy. highly reccomend it. wish i lived in alaska...","strain":"alaskan-thunder-fuck","user":"mynameissnowwhite","stars":"5","date":"4/7/2014 3:12 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Focused","Sleepy","Hungry","Happy","Giggly","Uplifted","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"144652"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"drnike","stars":"3","date":"4/7/2014 3:53 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"144653"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"jack-herer","user":"drnike","stars":"3","date":"4/7/2014 3:53 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"144682"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"purple-ak-47","user":"ddevineuw","stars":"5","date":"4/7/2014 4:37 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Focused","Happy","Relaxed","Hungry","Headache","Sleepy","Talkative"],"ID":"144683"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Smells like candy-weed, hence the name.

Two solid bong hits to feel it, 4-5 to catch a reasonable high. \"Mids\" is an accurate description. \n\nIt starts off with a foggy high and a bit anxious. There's a body buzz after four or so hits, and on the comedown which is after about an hour it's real lazy and comes with a bit of a headache, much like coming down from caffeine. \n\nSmell: Nothing special, almost non-existent until you crack open a bud, then it has a hint of dill.\n\nTaste: Again, nothing special. Burnt plant matter with hints of dirt. Surprisingly it's not harsh. Never makes me cough.\n\nOverall I'd give it a 5. It's probably one third as strong as \"medical grade\" weed like Blue Dream or Mr Nice, and it's reflected in the price- $45 1/4 oz (non-border, non-medical state)- much like it was for the same product circa 1988.\n\nOne thing I'd note however is that it seems Mexican \"Sativa\" has seemingly tipped to the indica side. It's as cheap and seedy as I recall, but a whole lot lazier. Eyes will droop and become dry, mouth will cotton. Smoke enough and it'll get the job done, but probably best left for when you're sharing with strangers or running low on quality nug.

The taste wasn't overwhelming but had a delicate citrus flavor hidden beneath a clean earthy flavor reminiscent of freshly composted soil. The buds were dense and burned nice and slow, which allowed us to get ample smoke for the small amount of buds that we had. It created a wonder head high that lasted 3-4 hours from one bowl.

If it were highschool and I was only smoking to get as stoned as possible (not that there is anything wrong with that AT ALL) it would be perfect. But my smoke is usually to alleviate PTSD, Anxiety, and the pain from titanium implants so this does not rank high on my list. JUST KNOW the effects are very trippy, very \"happy\", slightly anxious with a hint of paranoia, and proper for social smoking i.e.-puff puff pass.

This flare even woke me up early to make a mad dash to the toilet.  None of the strains I have been vaping over the past few months have really calmed it down.  (I realize that Rick Simpson and Shona Banda have developed cannabis ingestion methods that work for Crohn's, but I have not yet had the opportunity to try these yet.)\n\nI checked Leafly and did not have any of the recommended Crohn's strains.  I didn't have any of the gastrointestinal disorder strains available either... except I noticed two of the listed strains, Fire OG and The White, are the parents of one strain I have: White Fire OG.  Well if both parents are good for gastrointestinal disorders, then surely the child must be too!  I immediately loaded it into my O-pen vaporizer and vaped away.\n\nAfter I had gotten plenty of medicine in my system, I felt something amazing.  My whole abdomen relaxed.  All of the tension released, like a bunch of muscles relaxing.  I haven't felt such a phenomenon of relaxation in my digestive system before with any other strain.  I kept vaping White Fire OG the rest of the day and had significant relief from this terrible Crohn's flare!\n\nI must also say that my legs and feet were relaxed too.  Even my vagina, rectum, and anus were noticeably relaxed (but not to the point that anything would be released unintentionally).  I felt calm and at peace.  My thoughts were crystal clear, my memory did not skip at all, and I could totally carry on coherent, serious business conversations with this stuff in my system.\n\nI recommend this strain for relaxing muscles and as a daytime medicine for those with Crohn's disease, other types of gastrointestinal disorders, and anxiety.","strain":"white-fire-og","user":"Delight","stars":"5","date":"4/20/2014 3:45 AM","attributes":["Concentrate ","Relaxed","Focused","Uplifted"],"ID":"147751"},{"_type":"dict","content":"amazing/.^ makes you feel weightless and foreget the bs\uD83D\uDC4C✔","strain":"girl-scout-cookie","user":"cakdaddy","stars":"0","date":"4/20/2014 4:17 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Giggly","Happy","Relaxed","Sleepy","Talkative","Uplifted"],"ID":"147752"},{"_type":"dict","content":"What I love about is that you feel that you're on another dimension.

You may get couch-locked, but the head high is very intense and locks you in a dream.\n\nThe only downside to this strain is the cotton mouth, but this is not a problem if you have come prepared with something to drink. \n\nThis strain has become my new favorite, with its intense mix of OG kush, master kush, and sour diesal, this strain will leave your body stuck but your head in the clouds.","strain":"headband","user":"tfwnoshoegazeqt","stars":"5","date":"4/18/2014 11:51 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Talkative","Tingly","Uplifted","Citrus","Flowery","Earthy","Pungent","Skunk","Woody","Pine","Diesel"],"ID":"147835"},{"_type":"dict","content":"smells like pine","strain":"pineapple-express","user":"keegan.dudley.3","stars":"4","date":"4/19/2014 1:29 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Energetic","Euphoric","Focused","Uplifted","Creative"],"ID":"147836"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Great for evening/night.\nHelps me take things down a notch and crushes my anxiety.\nGood for focus.","strain":"purple-urkle","user":"KonchogYeshe","stars":"5","date":"4/19/2014 3:05 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"147837"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Fire\uD83D\uDD25 best shit ever bruh.

I dosed about 30 big hits last night (I'm a bigger guy so don't worry), and I am still very medicated, and my last  dose was at 3:15am, and it is currently 9:55am.

This one has been great. I have had problems with paranoid episodes that can completely ruin my highs so it has been somewhat of a chore finding what sits well with me. I am slowing breaking into being able to smoke more kinds and plushberry was one of the first. I was able to smoke this over a year ago now and found it very forgiving and pleasant in smaller quantities. I was given this by my sister who purchased it from a Seattle dispensary and was happy. Well her plushberry I smoked for the first time a couple months ago and was pretty stoned after 4 smaller bong rips. It is and even high so you don't find yourself continuing to feel more stoned after 10 minutes like some creepers out there. I feel tingly, floaty, relaxed and pain free. It can tackle the head giving a pretty euphoric feeling that like most high end flowers. I experience time lapses, slightly blurred vision, and difficulty thinking for the first 30 minutes then it begins to subside leaving me VERY relaxed, able to follow the tv, happy, giddy, and euphoric. It seems to last for some time also...I smoked maybe 6-7 times starting at noon and finished at around 8pm. I am not writing this with a light buzz at midnight.\n Sorry for rambling but I still feel pretty good....as with any of my reviews know the everyone is different and experiences can be very different.

And let me say, it was absolutely great, I was a little couch locked, but that was mostly because there wasn't much to do and I was tired before the use of it. After a bit though I wanted to do things, be creative, and work on things. It was absolutely great other than a bit of dry mouth that comes with Cannabis. Listening to music was pretty trippy too (I think I spent about 2 hours listening to music) and had an overall great day because of it.\n\nSide Note : After experiencing this beauty whilst under no other substances I decided to quit drinking and overall changed my life completely. Less drinking, less money spent (Smoking is cheap compared to drinking for me), Smoked a bit more (Happier), less depression and anxiety that comes with my disorders. Overall I think it helped me turn my college GPA around to be honest. Another thing though to note is, if you officially have ADHD, whether it be ADHD-PI (ADD), ADHD, or combined ADHD, and you have academics to worry about, or something that requires focus and clarity, smoking weed will NOT help you focus clearly, that is what your prescribed stimulants are for. I do though recommend it as possibly being a reward for doing good. If you do have BPD and feel you have an episode coming on that is more important though, I do recommend any cannabis as an emergency relief/escape from heading into a BPD episode.","strain":"blue-dream","user":"jumba898","stars":"5","date":"4/21/2014 9:49 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Focused","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Uplifted","Dry Mouth","Blueberry","Sweet","Earthy"],"ID":"148846"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"bubba-kush","user":"hbomb55","stars":"3","date":"4/21/2014 9:59 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"148847"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Trainwreck was probably my favorite bud this past year.

Although she yields well under ideal conditions she is grown primarily by those growers looking for that special, relaxing and refined Blueberry high.  \n\nShe may not be the easiest variety for the newer grower, and can be a fussy feeder, but she will repay the experienced grower with harvests of perhaps one of the best cannabis varieties available. Still a coffeeshop favourite decades after she was introduced.  \n\nSource:\nhttp://www.dutch-passion.nl/en/cannabis-seeds/product/blueberry/","strain":"55e3b2ec-3f88-477e-bd54-9e0afb0944ae","user":"jouke.dutchpassion","stars":"5","date":"4/24/2014 1:27 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Creative","Sleepy","Relaxed","Uplifted"],"ID":"149841"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"strawberry-diesel","user":"kromber","stars":"2","date":"4/24/2014 1:22 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Hungry","Sleepy"],"ID":"149840"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"55e3b2ec-3f88-477e-bd54-9e0afb0944ae","user":"jouke.dutchpassion","stars":"0.5","date":"4/24/2014 1:28 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Berry","Blueberry"],"ID":"149842"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Beautiful 2014 Cannabis Cup winner!
