[{"_type":"dict","content":"Type: Indica/Sativa Hybrid\nCross: Grapefruit X Herojuana\n\nThe Dirty Harry marijuana strain is not named after Clint Eastwood. She's named because the female grapefruit bx1 smells and tastes very earthy, like dirt. Her Grapefruit mother was crossed with a male Blueberry and then crossed back again with another Grapefruit clone. The result is sweet, citrusy, earthy, berry goodness that will spin your head around and around! When the Herojuana was crossed in, bud density and stoneage strength was increased. The final result is a plant that grows easily, even for beginning home marijuana cultivators. This strain has truly strong genetics and needs only the basics to do her thing: intense lights, pure water, quality nutrients and carbon dioxide.\n\nPicked up from Farmer's Market. This particular one was not all that impressive. Will try from dispensary next time.","strain":"cb38d3bb-42fd-4ec5-acf6-a2788896de7f","user":"jddye7","stars":"2.5","date":"10/17/2013 11:28 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Uplifted","Citrus","Earthy","Woody"],"ID":"100010"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I love this strain , good thick flavor, not harsh, hits hard but gentle.","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"IndicaToka","stars":"4","date":"10/18/2013 2:16 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Relaxed","Happy","Talkative","Uplifted","Anxious","Dry Mouth","Paranoid","Lime","Pungent","Skunk","Diesel"],"ID":"100011"},{"_type":"dict","content":"joint.","strain":"purple-diesel","user":"travisw","stars":"0.5","date":"10/18/2013 2:19 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"100012"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Second try with this strain today, smoked 3/4 of a joint.

Camo  greens and yellows with classic sienna pistils[\"hairs ;) ].. In bright daylight, the trichromes shine, giving it a glittery effect. 4/5\n\nTexture: Buds are solid and stiff..A good halfway point between uberfluffy sativas and rock hard indica buds. Resinous and sticks to the fingers somewhat, but nothing overdramatic. 3/5\n\nSmell: There is a mild fruit/blueberry smell present for which the strain is named.. However, the predominant aromas are that of pine and earth. Perhaps, this particular crop was grown outdoors? Upon a second trial, the blueberry smell is definitely there.. Overall, the weed has presence thru a ziplock bag, but definitely milder than some of the heavy indicas out there. 3/5\n\nTaste: No fruitiness here..This pot is very earthy tasting with more of the pine overtones. It was definitely grown in a rich soil medium, whether indoors or out, as the taste is very evident on a fresh green hit. While evidence of soil growing is pleasant in its own right, the flavor was nothing particularly spectacular. The smoke is kind of harsh on the throat, perhaps do to it being a bit dry and a bit resinous. 3/5\n\nPotency: This marijuana is a THC bomb! Surprisingly intoxicated off of one solid pipe hit..A couple of decent rips would put down a novice smoker. Not the strongest I've smoked in my life, but definitely more potent then the average grade A stuff. I can pack a single bowl and take single hits off this, and be as high as I comfortably want to get for an entire evening.. The high tends to be a creeper, the full effects setting in 20 minutes later, lending to a \"holy shit!\" sort of feeling :) Very impressed in this aspect. 5/5\n\nEffects: Apparently this strain is a 60/40 Indica/Sativa hybrid. It may be that my last stash was 100% indica, but the sativa really shines thru on this strain, more so than the indica. Provided you havent retarded yourself by disrespecting the potency, the overall buzz of this pot is very social and chatty..extrospective..Movies and music are a blast as the herb helps pull all the richness and perhaps overlooked details of whatever entertainment you choose..This weed is light-hearted and fun(again, if you didnt subject yourself to multiple bong rips)..\n\nThe body high is pleasant and tingly..Some nice feelings of \"stretchiness, melting, and energy waves\" as the evening progresses. However, the euphoric analgesia and muscle relaxation isnt as profound as my former stash of indica. Maybe not the best weed for treatment of pain, this marijuana seems to be better suited for socializing.. While this bud provides a mental and social stimulation, it still leaves the body relaxed and lazy, unlike pure sativas that have me doing chores and hiking in the woods.. A nice well rounded high that is great for chilling around the house with friends or alone. Would work well at concerts, museums etc. also.\n\nThis pot didnt really give me the crucial munchies like some other weed..however sweet things and wine had exceptional flavors. I also slept perfectly fine[sometimes sativa dominant highs stimulate the mind enough to disrupt sleep for me]\n\nPower-houring this weed however, will probably leave you pretty couch locked and spaced out, because you'll be too fucked up to do much else ;) Oh and a word of caution, this pot seems to mix well with beer and wine, but definitely will contribute to a feeling of drunkeness, if you are stupid enough to drive.  4/5\n\n20 a gram   55 an eighth 100 a quarter...worth the money.","strain":"blueberry","user":"thezenunderground","stars":"3.5","date":"10/22/2013 1:09 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Focused","Euphoric","Talkative","Tingly","Uplifted","Happy","Dry Mouth","Dry Eyes","Dizzy","Berry","Blueberry","Earthy","Woody","Pine"],"ID":"100230"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Migraine pain 7-8; nausea 6-7 when I medicated @ 1900.

As in, your train of thought continues with your observation/perception of your experience, but your thoughts spark an idea, and suddenly a whole chain of neurons of related ideas is set afire. It takes off like a lit fuse to an explosion, and runs away from your control of your immediate attention span (for 10-40 seconds in my experience). \"And then before you know it\" happens still later! I'd had myself a small world of a daydream in itself. It reached a quick crescendo-- it felt like my adrenaline/endorphins/happychems topped off-- and then reached a sudden, if pleasingly satisfactory, stop. The train of thought had completed itself. At that moment existence was a mini pause and I remembered where I was now, and before, and was able to refocus my perception to zoom out and see the entire journey I'd taken in its small entirety of ~15 seconds (for me. also depends on the thought). The train of thought because an independent thought with a life of its own. A new tree in my neural network kingdom. I will wander back to it and climb it again some day soon.\n\nI described all this to my SO, asking if the whole neuron firing thing was possible on certain kinds of pot/brainchemcombo. He agreed it was a plausible description. Therefore it may be in agreement to other peoples' experiences as well. So I figured I'd share.\n\nOther details:\nMy attention span itself is shook up in a sprinkled scattered kind of way. Everything in my senses lends itself to the experience of thought development, so whatever you think of is somehow made of everything present, in a perfect way. Music is the soundtrack to your thoughts in a much deeper way than before, somewhat overtaking your attention span.\n\nThe runaway firing is fun-- to see where it takes you, and what fun, awesome ideas you find there-- but I also sense the loss of control in a somewhat bad way. In general, I say that pot \"gives me ADHD\" (I am not diagnosed as such), because my attention span singularizes, and thus I lose decent multitasking function. It's pretty silly sometimes. Like, I'll be doing something while lucid that keeps my concentration focused on it quite precisely yet without much effort. Then I have a few puffs off the vape, and suddenly the task I was doing before becomes much harder to think about and remember what I'm supposed to do with it next.\n\nThere's also a rather significant split in myself, it almost seems... Part of me ends up in a continuous loop of realizing/remembering what's going on, and then diving into it trying to get back into the feel and journey of the thought, only to lose myself again-- as it tumbled away in rapids and currents. Only to end up back at the realization moment again.\n\nThe rest of me has bought the ticket and taken the ride-- another seed of my attention/consciousness follows the fuse light along its path. It has a full, rewarding life before sputtering out like the neuron chain. It even contributes to the free association and thus development of the chain, if that makes any sense. And it's also what comes back to my other brain to tell the tale. :)\n\nIn the end, this review is a tale of two (primary, anyway) thought trains, always meeting in the middle and then circling away again.\n\nPS: I don't mean looping in the repetitive way. (Ask me about what time looks like animated sometime.)","strain":"girl-scout-cookie","user":"sunnyhell","stars":"0.5","date":"10/23/2013 4:29 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Mint"],"ID":"100556"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This was a very good choice.

The aftertaste is nothing special though, to me it didn't linger.\n  I'm a light smoker, so I usually smoke about a 1/4 of my blunt and then put it out. I do this to enjoy my high and to also build my tolerance back up to what it used to be. I was pretty baked off the small amount I hit this stuff, it's pretty potent if not smoked responsibly. I smoked half of a blunt a few nights ago and had a bad trip for about 15-25 mins, so if you're a lightweight, please take caution!!!!! The high dropped my eyes, and made me very relaxed after the mind rush plateaus into the blueberry kush bliss. I had a clear head after the rush, and was also very talkative (if I was very interested in the topic at hand, I felt like giving a speech every time I opened my mouth lol). The high lasts a while (especially with the small amounts I smoked), it sent me right to bed or into the land of arousal lol. This is like an aphrodisiac of bud, definitely can get you in the mood, and increase the sensation of sexual arousal. \n  Overall this an ok smoke, I copped an 1/8 for $30 and an additional gram for $10.

My dispensary owner has been rumoring about its arrival, and I must say, it has lived up to the rumors. This strain provided a very \"heady\" high! Most of the effects that were strongly noticeable to me involved my mentality rather than my body. I am aware of the genetics of this 2011 Cannabis Cup Winner strain, but this strain had a very noticeable sativa feel to me. Now this is for me, and I am a regular indica user, therefore maybe I am unaccustomed to the sativa feel of a \"buzz\". Nevertheless, this strain was very entertaining! I found myself thinking extremely odd things, and laughing at the simple things my wife did! My only complaint is the length of the high. Now this may be strange to the stoners out there, but as I said before, I prefer an indica high. That being said, I usually dose before I go to bed. Now that does not mean that I didn't enjoy the \"heady\" high that this strain gave, I just wish I was a bit shorter. Another point I promised to make regarded a new experience for me with marijuana. After I had come down fro  this \"heady\" high, I was able to solve a problem that my colleagues and I have been stumped on for weeks!

You will experience a nice smoke, not harsh but still with some punch to live up to the Fire name.  The immediate effect that I felt after smoking (glass pipe) was a relief of joint pain, anxiety and a noticeable shift of focus and awareness towards present.  I think this train deserves to be smoked in a high-tech glass water-rig to get the full flavor.\n\nTo my nose, it has a moderate earthy smell, with a steady sweet after-tone and a very minimal if not a complete lack there of chemical smell.

I purchased this indica-dominant hybrid sample from Denver Relief, being very impressed with the bag/jar appeal. The bud would simply appear light green with light orange hairs if it weren't completely covered in trichomes, giving it an almost white appearance. Despite some mild fox-tailing, the buds are pretty dense. Bio Jesus has a light and crisp aroma that smells of a vague floral scent with hints of tropical fruits. When the buds are broken into a sharp pine flavor emerges. The flavor is reminiscent of the smell, except for the overwhelming chest-expansion and nose-biting. The herbal and spicy smoke is not unpleasant, but certainly harsh even through a water filtered device. Vaporizing is the best way to experience the complex bouquet of Bio Jesus.

I was not disappointed with it whatsoever. The high was incredibly pleasant. I would describe it not so much as heavy or powerful, but rather, a very nice buzz. It was fun, uplifting, and I found myself behaving more creatively. This is the sort of strain that I love to write music on! I found that with the White Widow, I was able to focus and concentrate decently. It behaved for me as more of a sativa; I was awake and euphoric throughout my experience. The strain lacked many of the adverse effects that some strains can give you, which was very nice. I had no problems with headaches or dizziness, which many strains tend to give me.

Fruity Pebbles is an interesting strain. It is a nice balanced cross between an indica and sativa, but from my experience with it I'd say it's a little bit more indica dominant due to the  nice body high it provides! \n\nAppearance: A nice bright green with bright orange hairs. The main thing I noticed was that there was very little trichomes covering the buds which made me a little skeptical at first.\n\nSmoke & Aroma: \nStaying true to it's name this strain really does smell like a form Fruity Pebbles although to me it smelt more like Fruit Loops. The smoke is very smooth on the lungs, it's not harsh at all leaving you with a nice mildly fruity and creamy aroma on the exhale! \"Just like smoking a cereal...\"\n\nEffects & Experience:\nAfter smoking one joint (sprinkled with kief) the high started to take effect in about 5 minutes. It started off with a mellow head high then dawned down straight into a body high. Walking became a little difficult and my legs became heavy, but I felt very euphoric / positive. It isn't the most potent strain but it still provides a very relaxing fun high; not so overbearing.  I'm still relatively a new smoker so I don't have a very high tolerance.\n\nDuration:\nThe high last for about 2 - 2 1/2 hours. Tolerance differences may vary.\n \nOverall:\nI would Fruity Pebbles is just right for hanging out with your friends, playing video games, going to a sports game, going to the beach, going to the movies, and ect...  I'd definitely recommend this strain anybody that just wants a comfortable relaxing high.","strain":"fruity-pebbles","user":"JuicyJustin","stars":"4","date":"11/12/2013 9:21 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Euphoric","Happy","Relaxed","Uplifted","Berry","Sweet","Earthy"],"ID":"103630"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Billed as a powerful sativa, the batch I had was nothing special.

I. Am. In. Love. Quite seriously and literally with everything. With my boyfriend, with my dog, with the weed I just smoked, with this peanut butter and banana sandwich I'm eating (holy crap I am IN LOVE with this sandwich!)... I feel so positive, like nothing could ever bring me down again, and I think I've declared this strain \"my favorite thing EVER\" at least half a dozen times since I smoked it twenty minutes ago.\nOn a more serious note, I went into this high already hungry, and barely felt like snacking when I was done smoking. When I did make myself food, however, I discovered it tasted so much better than I had expected. So I'm eating and enjoying it, but it's more because I'm enjoying the flavors, and I'm taking my time so I can savor each bite. \nI was also exhausted before I smoked and now I feel like I could muster up the strength to Do Something, if I had to. This one is a little hard to judge since, like I said, I was already really tired going into it, but I feel like it's worth mentioning that I do feel a nagging urge to go sketch. \nIt's doing AWESOME things for my Fibromyalgia aches and pains!! I was in extreme amounts of pain, probably around a 7, and I'd say I'm down to a comfortable 3 or so now (which is my baseline about as good as it ever gets). There is some anxiety, but it's not overwhelming. Now that I've eaten, it feels a little better. \n\nAnd after writing all of this, I have to conclude that it's also a very focused high that's allowing me to really get into what I'm doing. I feel very aware and alert, not at all clouded or impaired.\n\nFor perspective, I'm a many-times-over daily smoker.","strain":"hawaiian-dream","user":"SallySmokes","stars":"5","date":"11/13/2013 3:55 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Euphoric","Uplifted","Focused","Creative","Anxious"],"ID":"103705"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"mars-og","user":"phil65","stars":"3.5","date":"11/13/2013 4:35 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Energetic","Relaxed","Sleepy","Aroused","Hungry"],"ID":"103706"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"shishkaberry","user":"phil65","stars":"4","date":"11/13/2013 4:38 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"103707"},{"_type":"dict","content":"top shelf meds that will keep you very alert to the world around you while also being able to pay attention to yourself.two zero two six nine seven six three two eight to order.","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"christianp","stars":"0.5","date":"11/13/2013 4:00 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Aroused","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Focused","Happy","Uplifted","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Talkative","Anxious"],"ID":"103710"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"shishkaberry","user":"phil65","stars":"4","date":"11/13/2013 4:38 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Euphoric","Relaxed","Hungry","Uplifted","Happy"],"ID":"103708"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Perfect strain and smells amazing","strain":"strawberry-diesel","user":"Iamabso","stars":"5","date":"11/13/2013 8:04 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Sleepy","Giggly","Paranoid","Dry Mouth","Strawberry","Skunk","Diesel"],"ID":"103709"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Dead Head taste like a mixture of coconut and blueberries.

If you want a strain you enjoy by tasting, this is definitely not that strain (I'd try either fruity pebbles or strawberry crunch for that). However, the effects of Platinum OG are strong and fast, and the buzz refused to back down for quite a few hours. Great for medical use with very spacey/stoney effects.

I noticed that everything about this strain is light; the color, the smoke, and unfortunately the effects. The buzz barely lasted for an hour and a half, and I probably smoked 2 g's by myself in the session preceding. I could get the same buzz from barely .25 g of Northern lights or Bubba kush.

Very green buds that have been dried to perfection. The pistils on this bud are an amber orange color and seem to blend into the dense green bud at their base. The bud itself is, as I said before, dense and it is also littered with trichomes. When you crack one of these nugs open you are immediately overcome with a strong skunk smell mingled with a floral tone; a particularly sweet smell but still very pungent scent. blueberry is a definite at least in this particular plant. The smell of this particular strain is amazing, one of my personal favorites for sure. \n\nAs a hybrid/sativa the smoke provides you with the best of both \"worlds\" as they say. This particular strand is very good for relief of depression and anxiety and has a very euphoric high leaving you feeling relaxed and alert. Blue Dream is also great for pain relief as an immediate effect was noted on my lower back muscles (my trouble muscles). This strain also produces a fairly strong dizzying effect, so take that how you will :P. This particular plant provides a light smoke that tastes very fruity when exhaled. I find that I enjoyed this strain the most out of a small glass handpipe as it let me enjoy the full blue dream flavor.","strain":"blue-dream","user":"jmiller77","stars":"4.5","date":"11/19/2013 6:19 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Creative","Happy","Relaxed","Uplifted","Dizzy","Dry Mouth","Sweet","Berry","Flowery","Tropical","Blueberry","Lavender","Pungent"],"ID":"104026"},{"_type":"dict","content":"pretty dope shit bruh, Junk smells good af and had me maad relaxed & floatin for awhile but more of a calm smooth sorta high.

I'd get relaxed and sleepy, sleeping the whole night. This strain, if used properly, I found, goes with what ever I need it to go. If I need to be awake it can allow that or if I need to sleep, it can do that for me as well.  I have a lot of trouble sleeping, more so now that I am weaning off opiates after 5 yrs, so I was very impressed with this strains ability to offer well deserved sleep as well as give me an appetite. Makes for a great \"Midnight Smoke\" as well, that always helps me fall back to sleep with its painkilling abilities.

This tends to leave patients with more of a euphoric experience that is full-bodied and quite honestly… a bit trippy. Only recommended to the highest tolerance patients that are looking to go far away.\n\nChemdawg is one of those marijuana strains you can space out easily for a few minutes, only to snap back into reality and wonder how much time just past.\n\nThere is a distinct gassy stench associated with Chemdawg that is very similar to Sour Diesel. The taste is similar; thick smoke reminiscent of diesel fuel. Very memorable smoke sessions with this strain. Always seems to relieve stress with just 1-2 puffs.

I purchased this indica-dominant hybrid sample from Denver Relief, being very impressed with the bag/jar appeal. The bud would simply appear light green with light orange hairs if it weren't completely covered in trichomes, giving it an almost white appearance. Despite some mild fox-tailing, the buds are pretty dense. Bio Jesus has a light and crisp aroma that smells of a vague floral scent with hints of tropical fruits. When the buds are broken into a sharp pine flavor emerges. The flavor is reminiscent of the smell, except for the overwhelming chest-expansion and nose-biting. The herbal and spicy smoke is not unpleasant, but certainly harsh even through a water filtered device. Vaporizing is the best way to experience the complex bouquet of Bio Jesus. The buzz is perhaps the best thing about this stain, however. After one good hit, even a seasoned smoker with a high tolerance will begin to feel the effects of this strong indica. This effective medicine may cause happiness, sleepiness, increased appetite, relaxation, and dry mouth. A fantastic choice for the evening or when being productive is not important.","strain":"bio-jesus","user":"BirdBrain","stars":"4.5","date":"11/22/2013 3:00 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Sleepy","Hungry","Relaxed","Dry Mouth","Tropical","Pine","Spicy/Herbal","Chemical","Diesel","Earthy","Flowery"],"ID":"104427"},{"_type":"dict","content":"The flavor is incredible.

Makes me feel like someone is massaging my muscles from within my body; sometimes it feels like there is electricity tingling down my limbs. Very effective for my chronic shoulder and neck pain. The pain is transformed into a sensation of heat that is not nearly as bothersome. My favorite effect Romulan has is that it intensifies auditory stimuli and deepens appreciation for music. Music (especially ambient, trance) sounds like it's in HD, or three dimensional. If I'm outside, it somehow makes me hear each sound as a separate \"layer,\" and I can choose which layer to focus on, which then makes the other layers recede into the background. Even subtle, distant sounds become much clearer. It's like I'm locking on to a signal and scanning it. It's extremely pleasant to lie down and listen to music with headphones on and then slowly drift off into a nice satisfying sleep. I sleep more deeply and wake up in less pain. Sometimes I'm a bit lethargic the day after. No other negative side effects apart from a bit of dry mouth and the munchies, which I usually avoid by sleeping shortly after smoking.","strain":"romulan","user":"Arminite","stars":"4","date":"11/27/2013 4:41 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Sleepy","Relaxed","Hungry","Tingly","Pine"],"ID":"105550"},{"_type":"dict","content":"It had a fruity/earthy flavor that was amazing!","strain":"cheese","user":"matthew90","stars":"0.5","date":"11/27/2013 6:52 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Energetic","Euphoric","Talkative","Dry Mouth","Flowery","Pungent","Cheese"],"ID":"105551"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Let's just say I'm having some difficulties writing this out...haha.

The weirdest CF movies, all too popular in the 80s, couldn't predict the influence of the technology on our everyday communication and the simplest work tasks. Internet has become nowadays our official office and VoIP had taken over the meetings, seminars, conferences, conversation and every type of contact in a workplace. It has become common to have a conference call with collaborators on a different continent, and <a href=\"http://www.giaspace.com/index.php/services/voice-over-ip-voip/\">IT service</a> made that possible with their low-cost and free of charge connection. But how far have the help tools and high-tech gadgets evolved and which one would suit best to your business organization? You should want something that is dependable and works perfectly, but you need as well a tool that is easy for all of your contacts to use. It is great to obtain a lot of advanced features, but it's not so peachy when collaborators you're trying to communicate with can't figure out how to join you or do not have appropriate software program.\n\n    Here are just some of the popular services you can chose from for your future online brainstorming:\n\nMeetingBurner   \nPopular because its very easy to use interface and free service. No downloads are necessary for meeting attendees. This is a web office where you can hold meetings, host seminars (webinars now) and share your screen presentation and videos with other collaborators. A good trait is its recording feature, easy to storage and preserve, so you can join the meeting whenever suits you and easily catch up. There are tools that help transfer the recording to other formats like YouTube for example. It has a chat and VoIP features, but the sharing of the presentations and videos is reserved for the organizers of the meeting. There is also a new MeetingBurner mobile application, so the conference participants on the move are not chained to their cubicle.\nYugma is highly innovative web conferencing service, great for sharing your screen and collaborating with your long-distance coworkers. Its weird name means “unified collaboration” and it is great for sharing ideas. With Yugma users have a sensation of an in-house meeting because it offers multiple platforms for them (the users of Mac, Windows and Linux can share desktops, mouse and keyboards). Yugma features audio conferencing, public and private chat, annotation, quick polls, whiteboard tools, VoIP and session recording. It is available through Skype integration and customization. The quality advantage is its investment in the security. Protection from data corruption and hackers is provided with 128-bit encryption.   \n\n\nWebEx   is a popular choice in the large enterprises for their web conference service. It has a good sound and video quality, not to mention the tools for working with groups like whiteboarding, note-taking, annotations... With WebEx you would get a great mobile access with iPad, iPhone, Android, Blackberry, or you can attend meetings on any 3g, 4g or Wi-Fi enabled device (just launch the meeting URL from a browser and no app download is required). There is a free trial period, but the price is $19/month and higher if you want more meeting participants.  \n\n\nTwiddle -a website that is extremely popular meeting place for groups. It immerses people in the brainstorming and the exchange of the ideas, images, graphics... It is very convenient for the collaboration with your long-distance friends and colleagues with whom you can browse the internet and hold conference calls. You do not need an account, no downloads or plug-ins. It's free for Educational Users, but after a trial run of one month, it costs $14/month for Professionals, $49/month for Teams and 189/month for Business account.\n \nGoogle+Hangouts is an alternative you can chose. It is not specified to the business arena, and it does not have the features to help exchange presentations, but it is the most familiar to everyone and very easy to access and navigate through for all users. You just need about 30 seconds to install the Google voice and video plug-ins. For free you can create a hangout and invite coworkers and friends to a video chat by Gmail. It is available “on the road” by Wi-Fi enabled mobile, or if you download Google+app for Android, iPhone, iPad.  \n\n     Of course there are many more options that you can check out and try on a couple of weeks for free: GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, Adobe Connect, Fuze Meeting, iLinc, iMeet, Join.me, Mikogo, Global Meet, Intercall, Jabbster, Sync.In, Vyew, Huddle, ShowDocument, ZOHO Meeting .....\n\n     However, even the smartest choice of these VoIP services and applications brings in a high risk factor and vulnerability, an easier way-in for hackers and viruses. The security is possible to achieve with a dedicated Managed Service which will monitor and preserve from intruders your choice of the new platform for long-distance communication and online conferencing.","strain":"77cb1eb1-7330-4e8d-af85-eb80a804821f","user":"GiaSpace","stars":"0.5","date":"11/28/2013 5:47 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize"],"ID":"106031"},{"_type":"dict","content":"excellent strain. good flavor and long lasting affect","strain":"blue-dream","user":"stripeddone1","stars":"4","date":"11/28/2013 10:02 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Focused","Happy","Hungry","Sweet","Blueberry"],"ID":"106034"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-dream","user":"Fulootron","stars":"5","date":"11/28/2013 10:29 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Happy","Relaxed","Energetic","Talkative","Sweet","Blueberry","Earthy"],"ID":"106035"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Northern Cali batch of white widow, firSt time with the strain.

But what a waste. Let's vaporize some. And then some... And then some... And then some... OMG! This bud hits forever! So much resin! Its so Robbin goddamn Thick! Nice start.\nThis weed is boom dynamite. And I prefer heavy, deeply felt sensations while stoned... and baby, this weed is nice. It does the trick. My fingers are just floating over these keys. And holy creeper alert! Put out an APB on a glowing faced kid writing a pot review. So, many of the bud's I vap, hit fast and upfront, like Sour D or Pineapple Express, but this Platinum Kush has a lag time, and its real nice. And get this! I got 5 solid pulls off my whip using the vap. There's two more in it for sure... I just had to tap out. Most weed, even my beloved Sour D, only yields about 3 good pulls before the bud in the hopper goes dry. But Platinum Kush is SO sticky and SO filled with its piney resin, that it just keeps giving vapor pull after vapor pull. Wow! And its a heavy vapor too... Which could be a potential downside in exchange for its yield and potency, that its thick on the lungs, more so than a less resin dense plant.\nThe high is very nice, and as I said earlier, it creeps. After I vap, I just go about my business, and observe what transpires. \nIn its infant phase, the high is mellow... nice... and I was like, \"ok, cool.\"; but its a creeper, so in about 3 minutes(i think), that mellow nice, started to ramp up in the area of my frontal lobe, until my head became a toasty warm quick silver beach, one all covered with warm white sand. Yummy in the Sunny! \nThis isn't even my first vap session today. I had one earlier, before I played soccer in my league's am game. This bud is great for focus and movement, for intensity and alertness... I felt like spider-man. I know, it seems contradictory to 'be high' and to be an athlete, but... some of my childhood, a lot of it in fact, leaves me very sad at times, and very distracted. So much so, that many of the things I like to do, I cant enjoy doing, because the feelings are so rapacious in their attempt to 'get my attention'.\nSo, I find that this Platinum Kush does an excellent job of giving the body a very beautiful sensation, one that compliments the tone's of anxiety fear and hardship. The result, my activities are more enjoyable and free flowing... And that just feels good I suppose. \nBut it certainly does not 'make' ones feelings or experiences 'go away'... for no weed is that good, except maybe, the weeds of one's own heart and mind.\nSo all and all. I give Platinum Kush high marks across the board. I'm amazed at how versatile it is. Good for sport, focus and tuning into the zone while exploring the body. And also, its buzz is extremely enjoyable to the senses in a way that would make movie watching, chess playing, reading, napping, and any sensual endeavors, a little more intense in feeling . The floaty wavy sensation that Platinum Kush offers, powerfully too I might add, is a beehive of sensation Platinum Kush is not for amateurs.\nDamn, time fly's by on this high... E=MC couch. Its been a solid two hours of being anywhere from super stoned to not as much super stoned.

I have never heard of this strain before, so I was very curious to try it. He said it was really good and that it was easier to get ripped off of it. How could I say no to that, so I bought an 1/8th. I tried to find it on leafly, but I couldn't so I decided to write a review. \n\nFirst Impression: Look's like your typical bud, dark green with a little brown here and there. The thing that initially set this bud apart from the others was it's amazing smell. The smell is very different from other buds and it is very pleasing to the senses. \n\nUpon Further Inspection: The bud breaks up in an average manner. When you break up a nug, feast your eyes upon trichomes after trichomes. Very frosty and it looks very enjoyable.\n\nSmoking It: I personally smoked out of a bowl and once a vaporizer with this bud. The Vaporizer high is good, and it is extremely calming. The bowl high is significantly better. When you are actually smoking, it will go straight to your head and may get a bit dizzy. One bowl pack and you can get stoned if you are a newbie or lightweight. Two bowl packs and you should be solid if you have been smoking for a bit or have a higher tolerance. Three bowl packs may get a veteran pretty high, but if you are a casual or intermediate smoker, you will be ripped. \n\nSmell: The smell of this bud once lit up is beautiful. It doesn't even smell like bud at all to be honest. It smells like a very strong cologne.\n\nThe High: The High is very relaxing. After you are done smoking and the dizziness stops, there is only good vibes to be found. The bud makes you happy, aroused, and giggly.\n\nThe Cons: Dizziness or very fast heartbeat when initially smoked. \n\nI give this a 4/5, it's high is worth a 3.5, but the smell is very good so I gave it a 4. Definitely worth trying if you can find it, or if it even exists, because this just maybe another strain of bud.","strain":"72715602-b76a-48d5-8590-d3566fd96fa8","user":"AzlanMusic","stars":"4","date":"12/2/2013 7:55 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Happy","Giggly","Hungry","Relaxed","Dry Mouth","Dry Eyes","Anxious","Sweet","Vanilla"],"ID":"106890"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"super-lemon-haze","user":"e-caban","stars":"2","date":"12/2/2013 8:28 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Focused","Euphoric","Energetic","Creative"],"ID":"106891"},{"_type":"dict","content":"11/03/2013 | 1.0 oz. | $325 | $0","strain":"durban-poison","user":"CEScroggins3Esq","stars":"2.5","date":"12/2/2013 10:51 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"106892"},{"_type":"dict","content":"WOW is pretty much all I can say.

The first time i tried this was in Northern California. I believe I started mmj in \"99\". My 1st prescription being from \"doc fry\" in Cool, California. My friend, we'll call him \"Joe\", grew some amazing outdoor mmj in the foothills of N.Cal. in 2007(?not for sure). This was the 1st mmj i had the opportunity to trim. All I can say about that is my fingers were covered in delicious finger hash within a very short amount of time. Upon smoking said finger resins, I was blown away. Since we hadn't smoked any of the bud yet(he wanted to cure it 1st). I was infatuated from the 1st puff. 1 hit was all that was necessary, one of those 1 hitter quitter. This is a very strong indica as far as i have found. Despite the fact that I could tell it was by its effects. Flavor, the first word coming to mind would be scrumptious. Super thick, funky, smooth, and pungent.4 out 5, easy going down. Effects, immediate, long lasting relief. Smoking this was one of the 1st times I was able to do normal daily tasks with more ease than usual, due to great pain relief, for numerous ailments 4.5 out of 5. Side note, sativa/indica seem to have the reverse effect on me compared to the \"normal\" mmj patient. i.e. instead of couchlock I get motivated to socialize and be out of the house. Medicinally beneficial for me 4.5 out of 5. Wouldn't really recommend to the novice(new to mmj). Unless you're ready to be \"messed up\", as my wife puts it.

The spaciness continues as the effect builds over the first 15 minutes, culminating in a rush of thoughts and internal energy that makes doing much of anything a bit difficult. Cerebral and almost racy gives way to a much more relaxing state in the latter half of the duration, with the body calming down and the mind feeling positive and clear.

Naturally, I was a bit worried that the second grow would be a shadow of its first grow, and so I decided to allow the buds to age over a month. \n\nUpon opening the sealed glass jar I am hit with a rich berry and butter smell that has the same eye-opening and mouthwatering affects but somehow feels more distinguished and soft. This isn't a pungent-skunky smell, rather it is a vapour of aged vines and deep forest.  My first vapouriser hit [2] is like walking into a pine forest, your feet crunching acorns on the forest floor as the woodland fills your senses.  The taste is of green hops which excites the mind and speeds-up thinking.  The mid-range is a hint of grapefruit and the finish is the zing you get from gargling mouthwash in the morning.  On the whole, it leaves you feeling refreshed, relaxed and alert.  \n\nMy hat is off to the care and love that could produce two such wonderfully different grows with the same strain, we can only hope Australia will leagalise so Colorado growers can compete with Australian growers to produce even better products (as they do with wine).\n\n[1]= http://www.leafly.com/indica/sensi-star\n[2]= Utilising an Aerizer Solo: starting at setting no.2 (365°F) for ten minutes, then to setting no.3 (383°F) for five minutes and finishing on setting no.6 (401°F) for ten minutes.

The high was as close to a head-only high as I've ever experienced, there is some body high going on, but it's subtle, my mind was where it was at. Many hours later I was gently placed back down. The smoothness of the whole experience is what makes this particular strain so exceptional. Gentle smoke, gentle lift off, intense but gentle high, and the gentlest let down ever. One word of warning, this is a true sativa. If you smoke this before bed, don't expect to get any sleep.

It can be anxiety inducing if you have too much, but not as much as others. Soon as you learn how to hit it right, it can be very good for stress relief. Just a good solid smoke with stress relieving properties. If you don't take too much, it's good for socializing with friends, smoke more and you'll be able to watch movies, play games or sleep.

The buds are insanely frosty, specked with purple leaves. It smells very piney and wood-like, with a taste almost similar but with a sweet berry that lingers after you exhale. The buds aren't especially dense, nor fluffy. \n\nIt ground up very well and was extremely easy to roll, as it'd keep it's shape, i.e. sticky. The smoke was smooth (a joint with paper filter) and it gave good white ash and a quick resin ring on the paper.  The high was something else, keep in mind the high is different for everyone, but this is how it affects me; it creeps up slowly but never surprising me by being higher than I meant to be, and yet it's a potent strain. I felt a uplifting, creative-inducing head-high with an equally soothing, tingly body high that left me very functional. It also is quite easy to talk and keep talking, but is very controllable. Great for anxiety, depression and mild pain relief.\n\nTL;DR, the smell is strong of pine and wood, the same the same but with an added sweet berry. Very sugar-coated with nice purple flecks.

Pain & nausea gone with NO ANXIETY/PARANOIA (an absolute must for me). Head buzz very mellow/nice. THC is low enough that I dint feel high @ all; which is perfect for me. My fav worker bud next to Harlequin. If there's a tincture with this strain; good God someone let me know! Perfect for pain/nausea without a heavy head buzz/psychoactive effects.

I really thought it had to be laced with something cuz it was so euphoric.  Sometimes I get a little panicky smoking weed, but this BD was like waves of happiness flowing in in subtle waves every 20 minutes or so.  No anxiety or panic at all...very gentle and a little spacey.  At one point I felt like shouting how good I felt.   I always go to the dispensary and get BD (Chemdawg/Headband too). Its cheap, and I am never disappointed.   Its kind of like going on a euphoria rollercoaster so beware it might make you a little manic.  Now,  I make it into firecrackers and eat a whole cracker and am on Planet 9 for about 5 hours or so.   I'm so euphoric I could care less about my headache :-).  I love watching stupid movies medicated with BD even though my attention goes in and out cuz I'm stoned.

He went to the toilet and came back about 15 minutes after with the most beautiful, conic, packed and straight hand rolled joint I've ever seen. We went outside to have a toke and the joint was hitting so slowly, yet, these were the biggest hits I ever took from a spliff. We came back inside about 10 minutes after stoned out of our mind and sat. For maybe 2 minutes, we didn't say a single word. And then we realized we could control time. When a car would pass and we were saying it was slow, we would see the car sort of slow down with the lights flattening being following it and when we'd say it was going faster, the car would start moving faster just like everything else around us.

Once you start to relax and float, you get real happy and just want all of the food in the world to be delivered promptly to your face. Super chill, but it keeps you coherent enough to hold conversations. Going to sleep was easy and painless. It really was an ideal night time bud for me, so that's that. <3","strain":"bubba-kush","user":"jumboshrimp8yoo","stars":"3.5","date":"1/6/2014 5:11 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Relaxed","Hungry","Happy","Tingly","Dizzy","Pine"],"ID":"115626"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"lavender","user":"jiltob","stars":"3.5","date":"1/6/2014 6:58 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Tingly","Grape","Plum"],"ID":"115627"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I enjoyed this strain.

I have tried all 3 varieties, Relaxed, Awake, and Chai(felt like relaxed). I have to say that without a doubt Dixie makes the highest quality edible product on the market. I bought a 10count tin of each of the varieties and here's what I thought of each. Taste on all had a small but noticeable weed flavor, but it was easily masked by the mint flavor of Relaxed and Awake and went well with the Chai flavor as well. The mints were softer and broke apart quickly and easily. It took me 1 mint and about an hour and 10min. for full effect with effects starting about an hour post dosing. For me the 10mg was perfect, functionally I was all there, but pain at bay. At 20mg or (2)mints I noticed I was border line close to having a bad time. I was able to manage simple things, but felt strongly medicated. It lasted about 5 1/2 hrs. With the Awake effects were typical  Sativa with more energy and drive. The Chai felt a bit more balanced with the great body high minus the couch lock. The Relaxed felt almost like full couch lock with extreme hunger followed by an un-fightable urge to sleep at around 4hrs. post dosing. I can say it is the best sleep that I have ever gotten both natural or with any other strain/medication. Overall Chai was my favorite of the 3 in terms of effects and after a hard day I prefer Relaxed.

I wanted my girl to smoke this with me, but she doesn't like to.  I, of course, did not force her.  I smoked one bowl and it worked almost immediately (5 minutes).  Also note-worthy:  the hits were very smooth.  I was pleasantly surprised.  After three-and-a-half hits (1 bowl for me), I stayed with my girl, who was watching TV, and thought I was going to get couch-locked one minute into sitting and watching TV next to her; but, I managed to get up because I wanted to lay down and chill.  After putting on some music, I got into bed alone and closed my eyes and prepared for the ride!  The music was good; it aided in putting me in a good, euphoric, and aroused mood.  During the high, I experienced a nice tingling sensation.  In addition, my head would move in rhythmic and dynamic patterns along with the beat of the music.  The high lasted long enough for me to enjoy--and be satisfied with--the ride, before I noticed it going away.  Even so, I managed to sleep right away with no troubles.  Going to go for a ride again tonight!\n\n[1/9/2014]\nNight #2...\nI have to mention the tingly body high again. It felt great and lasted a good while.

I actually vaped more than I normally do and my thoughts were so vivid that I could almost see them visually.

BEWARE! \nFirst of all the smell is EXTREMELY pungent and can be smelled through many plastic bags and even medicine canisters. It looks almost engineered in how it grows into healthy fat and dense buds that are COVERED in Orange-Red hairs and white THC crystals. It is the most distinct smelling and looking strain I've ever come by. I was hesitant at first because the smell and amount of white crystals and kief in between the dense almost unnatural looking amount of hairs, some of which were thicker placed almost looking like tree moss. To be honest at first I thought it was laced or compacted herb but no I can assure the buyer it sure is Sativa. It is a mix between strong lemon/grapefruit/citrus and ammonium scent. It is a little pungent for my liking but friends love it. I have noticed it is hard to judge how much to smoke as it doesn't have the sleepy cutoff of Indica. I have noticed it is very ineffective in treating my depression and PTSD, as my mind usually functions at a high rate normally (diagnosed with multiple depression and add issues). On this strain I go ADD on everything or am stuck on one topic for hours. By that I mean my browser will have 15+ tabs ranging from different videos, articles, descriptions, pictures, social media, etc. when I am in a good mood and smoke, also good for video gaming. BUT, when I am depressed as I am now and have some nonviolent PTSD, it is basically a one way focus on my biggest suffering in which I cannot smoke more and escape from. So basically it enhanced my PTSD and depression and multiplied the feelings while making my mind so focused on that one thing that I cannot escape or relieve myself of suffering until I fall asleep by taking an ambien. It is a real hit or miss strain for me. Best recommended for college students wanting to focus on homework or on research assignments and or cramming before finals. Can be a social clear-headed day strain.\n NOT GOOD FOR DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, OR PARANOIA.","strain":"snowcap","user":"5rshwillz","stars":"3","date":"1/19/2014 7:49 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Energetic","Creative","Focused","Relaxed","Uplifted","Tingly","Dizzy","Anxious","Paranoid","Pungent","Ammonia","Citrus","Lemon"],"ID":"121050"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"girl-scout-cookie","user":"kasiavandinter7","stars":"3","date":"1/19/2014 10:14 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Uplifted","Relaxed","Euphoric","Happy","Hungry","Menthol","Pine","Skunk","Tea","Sage"],"ID":"121057"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"chemdawg","user":"Wolf_Wasp","stars":"4.5","date":"1/19/2014 4:48 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy","Giggly","Uplifted","Tingly","Dizzy","Dry Mouth","Dry Eyes","Anxious","Skunk","Pungent","Woody","Pine","Coffee","Diesel"],"ID":"121058"},{"_type":"dict","content":"has a nice upper head high, burns smooth, relaxed my anger, and actually made me rather happy. =) ","strain":"hollands-hope","user":"sourdeezsmoke","stars":"4","date":"1/19/2014 5:21 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"121059"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Grew the strain and i have to say it's some really good flowers.

Got to dinner and had some visual distortions, which made me paranoid that the people I was with would notice I was different, however, the only difference was I was more in tune with the group, present and able to laugh at things that were funny.  Felt so good to finally be able to laugh freely.","strain":"strawberry-cough","user":"roman09","stars":"5","date":"1/19/2014 1:55 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Uplifted","Energetic","Paranoid","Strawberry","Earthy"],"ID":"121072"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Great for relaxing, muscle pain and sleep.","strain":"headband","user":"Qor1n","stars":"4.5","date":"1/19/2014 4:44 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Relaxed","Euphoric","Dry Eyes"],"ID":"121074"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"a01641a9-504a-4fc5-92f2-6540e51d29e9","user":"Qor1n","stars":"5","date":"1/19/2014 4:56 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Energetic","Dizzy"],"ID":"121075"},{"_type":"dict","content":"My friend brought this over tonight and we split a joint.

It can be energizing, enhancing in focus and brain power, and uplifting in the search for knowledge. It is a relatively clear headed high that doesn't have a low over-do limit like most Indicas and Hybrids. \n\nOthers have recommended it for Depression, PTSD, and Anxiety but I highly advise AGAINST doing that. I suffer from all three and usually have a lightly enhanced level of paranoia no matter what strain I smoke. That being said this strain made my mind so focused on the feelings that are bringing me the most suffering, while energizing me so I can't easily fall asleep to escape. No matter what I've done to get myself out of fits after smoking this while feeling lost, I could not. My mind would go directly back to that negative feeling and images flashed in my mind of memories tied to the cause of the suffering. As you could imagine, not too fun. \n\nAbout it: It looks fake, to put it bluntly. It is the most distinct strain in many ways that I've come across. It is PUNGENTLY lemon/ammonia smelling that is overpowering sometimes to some, very pleasurable for others. It also gives the appearance of being fake because it buds in dense fat nuggets that are lighter green and almost covered in THC and vibrant colored hairs. HAIRS everywhere! Definitely one of the hairiest strains I have ever seen, and I have had it tested to make sure it wasn't some other herb compress or fake weed. It is indeed just a very distinct and bold strain of Sativa. \n\nI would recommend buying a small amount and seeing how it effects you. I've seen positive and negative reviews for Depression, Anxiety, ADD/ADHD, and mental disorders so it seems the strain chooses the smoker in a way. \n\nGive it a shot if you have taken or have needed to take medications like Ritalin, Adderall, Welbutrin, or similar drugs. Or if you are one of those college \"dopers\" cramming for finals.","strain":"snowcap","user":"5rshwillz","stars":"3","date":"1/19/2014 8:06 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Focused","Talkative","Uplifted","Happy","Dry Eyes","Anxious","Paranoid","Pungent","Ammonia","Lemon","Earthy","Citrus"],"ID":"121079"},{"_type":"dict","content":"1 of my favorite strains.

I was on a couple of walks during separate occasions and felt slightly energized and motivated.  The air was fresher, interactions with other humans weren't as annoying as they usually are, and I was very talkative and happy -- I was in a very easy going mood.  The world seemed to be more enjoyable.  \n\nOverall, this strain was enjoyable all around.  The taste was exceptional and the buds were extremely resinous and dense.

Many of us that grew up in Southern California and during the 'Generation-Y' era feel a deep, personal connection to this strain as we smoked it in many of our early experiences with marijuana.  These genetics first became widely available at some of the 1st medical dispensaries in LA during the 90's.\n\nPre-98 Bubba Kush is well known as a cannabis containing several STRONG flavors.  As I smoke this, filtered out of a heavy, beaker bottom JBD, the most prominent tastes and smells I associate with this bud are skunk and citrus smells followed by the strong distinct orange citrus flavor from the classic OG Kush that mothered this hybrid.  Another obvious flavor your taste buds pick up quickly is a strong 'earthiness' that I like to explain as tasting exactly like wet soil, perfect for gardening.  There are a couple fairly subtle notes that I always detect in Bubba which include coffee and pine.\n\nThe beauty of the pre-98 Bubba Kush may ellipse both it's smell and taste.  The plant has some of the most perfectly trimmed, shaped and crystallized buds known to man and has been known to yield large quantities. \n\nMy favorite thing about pre-98 Bubba Kush is the amazing high it gives you!!  Both body and heady, this high has been known to put me in any type of mood I want to be in at that time making it #3 on my favorite buds of all time list!  If I have a lot of work to do that day, this bud has gotten me though these projects in record time.  If I want to go fishing all day, this bud will give me the most fun fishing experience possible!!!  It's a very versatile cannabis.\n\nKeep on chiefin'\n-The Weedman","strain":"pre-98-bubba-kush","user":"mklodt","stars":"5","date":"1/20/2014 6:08 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Talkative","Tingly","Uplifted","Dry Mouth","Orange","Lime","Skunk","Coffee","Earthy","Pine"],"ID":"121143"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Very good for my back pain, also awesome for nausea.","strain":"alaskan-thunder-fuck","user":"richardtorbett","stars":"0.5","date":"1/20/2014 8:41 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize"],"ID":"121144"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"mk-ultra","user":"Hani","stars":"5","date":"1/20/2014 10:36 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize"],"ID":"121146"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Nice","strain":"white-widow","user":"Koensh","stars":"0","date":"1/20/2014 11:52 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Focused","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Talkative","Sweet"],"ID":"121147"},{"_type":"dict","content":"One of the best strains I've ever smoke.

It produces a very heady, uplifting and hazy high.\n\nAlthough it's not widely known as a bud with pronounced flavors, the Island Sweet Skunk strain can actually be very flavorful!  If you have a well grown batch, you can taste a very pronounced sweetness to the bud that contains faint notes of vanilla, nutmeg, and sometimes butter.  As you exhale, these notes fade into notes of honey and almost a molasses taste.  Along with the vanilla, I sometimes taste the indistinct flavor of Fall which I think is actually a hint of red apple.\n\nThis Colorado grown Island Sweet Skunk almost gives you the feeling that you are floating a few inches above the ground, or the chair you're sitting in, while at the same time, you are surrounded by a very light fog.  This fog is almost completely invisible, except for the opaque feeling of a smoke-like substance layered between you and the existential items within your view.  Physically, there is a strong tingling sensation behind my eyes in addition to other areas of my face like my cheeks.\n\nKeep smoking,\n-The Weedman","strain":"island-sweet-skunk","user":"mklodt","stars":"3.5","date":"1/20/2014 12:55 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Focused","Happy","Uplifted","Apple","Butter","Vanilla","Honey"],"ID":"121164"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I was not impressed by the look or smell of this bud, but was pleasantly surprised by its taste and potency level.

No head rush, no body high, just a gentle buzz worth maybe $1.50. So one of two things happened here: Either I got ripped off by my provider (unlikely for several reasons) or there is no such thing as \"Jack Herer\" or any other strain label - cultivators, dispensaries & dealers just use whatever the fuck name they think will move product at the moment. I've seen that argument made convincingly elsewhere by industry researchers. Cause there may be some knock-out Jack Herer somewhere, but that sure as shit ain't what I got.

Although the smell was great and made you want to keep smelling it, the high was the main reason I rated this bud a 4 star. At first I didn't feel very high so i kept toking, and then it hit me. One of, if not the best high i've ever had... I recommend this bud to ANYONE who feels like going out and getting shit done!! There was virtually zero \"couchlock\" effect, in fact the opposite was the case for me. Shortly after smoking this plant I felt as if I had taken NZT-48 (the access more of your brain pill from limitless).One more thing I'd like to add before I wrap this up is that this strain left me feeling motivated with ZERO anxiety that usually comes with smoking, smoke this during the day.

Feeling great afterwards still (hour/so later).","strain":"lemon-haze","user":"sarfo","stars":"3.5","date":"1/28/2014 1:10 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Hungry","Happy","Uplifted","Citrus","Lemon","Lime","Earthy"],"ID":"122649"},{"_type":"dict","content":"so sleepy so so sleepy ","strain":"blue-dream","user":"sensei","stars":"4","date":"1/28/2014 2:02 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Hungry","Sleepy","Earthy"],"ID":"122650"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Exceptional quality.

It was grown Hydroponic deep water culture using the Lucas Formula with General Hydroponic nutrients. Used a T-5 4bulb 24\" fixture with CFL's for suppliment lighting. Light cycle was 24/7. Ph maintained at 5.8. At about 3 weeks into Veg the plant was topped and a scrog net was installed about 8\" above the plant so the side branching from the sides of the could be spread to promote lateral growth. The total amout of time saved as opposed to growing a non-auto strain was about 2 weeks. Growth was very impressive from a t-5 as I've always used 600w HPS for flowing.. Yeild was about 2.5 OZs. using scrog. Could have cured and flushed a little better but had to hurry and harvest because we were moving into a new place. The high was very clear and slowed time a bit, but the effect was almost instant. The flavor was kind of piney with a bit of musky after taste. High lasted about 45 mins to 1 hour after a hefty bowl. Pretty easy to grow, this grow was done in a closet. Temps were 75-80 F. Humidity was right at 50% with no Humidifier or suppliment moisture. Not really a strain to worry about as far as smell is concerned. Highly reccomended for first time growers or peeps with little space to work with. Good stoney smoke but not going to knock your socks off or turn you into a zombie. Play video games, or watch a movie or somthing. Didn't make me wanna workout or go for a bike ride.

And noticed some help for bi-polar and neurological relief .. But the grapefruit gets confused with its twin ( grapefruit/ sour diesel ) smells very similar with a twinge of skunk .. Original grapefruit is an indica dominant strain that finishes as early as 7 weeks and no longer than 8 1/2 weeks due to loss of potency , very short stalky wide plant very close node growth ,, example 4 week veg in 7 gal will be no taller than 2 1/2 feet tall when finished , beige hue when done organically it is the best finishes with a ruby red grapefruit with sugar on top flavor and smell ..

This is a 'must try' for those in search of a strain that will keep you high, not stoned.  I believe this to be more on the Sativa influence, due to it's high.\n\nThe budtender had recommended it and said it helped him focus without any spaciness.  I am using it to treat my ADHD that I had been previously treating through Adderall and Vyvanse for almost 10 years.  I (and everyone else around me) got tired of the irritability and 'edge' it gave me, making me look and act like an a*shole!  I am glad I re-discovered the benefits of this magical plant.\n\nBack to the RMC…the buds are nice, tight, and compact little 'nuggets', averaging in size, comparable to those large red globe grapes. RMC shows a fair amount of red hairs and lots of juicy crystals.  A citrus-like smell while fresh, as well as while smoking or vaping, it is a turns out to be your nice daytime \"cup o' coffee\", but without the jitters.  Light-medium smoke with a zesty finish of citrus. \n\nOnset is fairly quick to come on (5-10 min) and keeps you high for about an hour or so, depending on your tolerance level.  It is a nice, cerebral, behind-the-eyeballs kind of high, with no 'stoned' or 'couch-lock' feelings.  Fully functional daytime, 'active' high that allows for concentration and awareness.\n\nDaily Dabs Wax Bar is just north of County USC Med. Center.

It is this background that makes Pineapple Express such a popular strain.  The jubilant sativa high can completely change your day and is very different from the mostly indica based strains popular on market.  You will want this medication in your life, and you will become giddy when you see it on a menu.  \n\nPineapple Express is a shiny bud, bright with trichromes, making for a pale green bud.  Juxtaposed against this pastel flower are orange hairs grouped in thick clumps.  When I broke it up, a fine layer of kief was left on the bottom of my dish, speaking to the number of crystals covering these buds.  The smell of this strain is sweet and succulent and lingered on my fingers long after I handled it.  There is a mouth watering effect when the tropical aroma is deeply inhaled.  While pineapple is assumed, it is more mango and pear: both luscious and juicy.  Tearing into this bud is like ripping into an off-the-branch-fresh fruit.  The flavor, although sweet in the green hit, is astringent in the exhale and can be harsh.  This can be the case with some sativas types.  \n\nAlthough Pineapple Express has some Afghani indica in its Trainwreck heritage, this is a predominantly sativa high.  It’s been touted as the happiest of highs--completely relaxed and carefree.  Medicating with Pineapple Express is a bit like going on vacation.  Even though it is mellow and cheerful, there is little chance you are going to get much work done.  This strain is distracting, and I had a hard time achieving much of anything.  It is much better enjoyed when responsibility can be shelved and the high can truly be enjoyed.  I’d strongly recommend this strain as an effective antidepressant.  It helps you forget yourself and unwind.  In today’s hectic world, it can be your stolen moment to center yourself.\n\nhttp://ocweedreview.wordpress.com/","strain":"pineapple-express","user":"OCWeedReview","stars":"3.5","date":"2/1/2014 7:30 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Pear","Mango","Ammonia"],"ID":"124160"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Super skunk was very very good! you could smell it across the room and it took me 1 hit and I was feeling it.

I have always preferred uplifting sativas, the type that set you going and give you the feeling like you can take on the world.  OCPC has grabbed a winner with their Strawberry Diesel.  Although there is some Afghani indica tucked into the NYC Diesel, overall, this was the euphoric sativa for which I was looking.  \n\nThe buds of this strain are a flush green.  Blended in among the flowers are hairs so faintly red that they are almost pink, a nice touch for a strain with strawberry in its name.  If you think you see a seed pod in the picture above, you are correct.  It has just been the one seed so far, and it has gone in my drawer for a future grow.  One seed aside, this is a nice looking strain. It is slightly sticky from the dusting of trichromes.  There is a clear odor of strawberries, fresh and organic, not sweet like artificial candy flavors.  Unmistakably, fuel and grapefruit are also present in this strain’s profile.  The taste favors the diesel flavor of NYC Diesel.  Much of the fruitiness you notice in the smell gives way too harsh fuel when burnt.  However, even with this gruffness, there is little smoker’s fatigue.  \n\nWhat I missed most during my run of indicas was the cerebral relief that sativas bring.  Along with arthritis pain and migraines, I often use my medical marijuana for work stress, anxiety, and at times, depression.  Strawberry Diesel is perfect for all three.  The high is happy and energetic.  The truest sign for me of whether a strain’s effects fall sativa or indica is what I do immediately after smoking.  If I sit there, mindlessly watching tv or messing around online like I have been all week, it’s most likely an indica.  If I get up, grab my keys, and get out the door or take out my computer to start working, like I have been with Strawberry Diesel, then we are dealing with a top notch sativa.  I’d recommend this strain as a daytime treatment for any number of psychosomatic symptoms.  It will leave you hopeful and excited, roused to take on the day.  \n\nhttp://ocweedreview.wordpress.com/","strain":"strawberry-diesel","user":"OCWeedReview","stars":"3","date":"2/1/2014 7:39 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Energetic","Creative","Focused","Uplifted","Strawberry","Diesel","Grapefruit"],"ID":"124191"},{"_type":"dict","content":"A great strain my favorite personally cause of the head/body high you get and how long it lasts too is great taste good and takes away all pain a great strain!\n","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"Crowell","stars":"5","date":"2/1/2014 7:51 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Giggly","Talkative","Uplifted","Happy","Energetic","Creative"],"ID":"124192"},{"_type":"dict","content":"nice smoke loved it","strain":"super-sour-diesel","user":"rich10503","stars":"4","date":"2/1/2014 10:13 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Euphoric","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Uplifted","Lemon","Pungent","Diesel"],"ID":"124196"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"strawberry-kush","user":"puffturtle","stars":"4","date":"2/1/2014 11:55 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Tingly","Uplifted"],"ID":"124199"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This is very excellent medication if you suffer from Depression.

Cozy and satisfying, there is something familiar about this strain, like it’s taking you home.  \n\nWhile I wouldn’t classify these nuggets as popcorn, they are small, bite sized buds.  Redwood Kush would be a deep forest green color if it weren’t absolutely drowning in pale amber trichromes.  The buds look like a pair of dirty khakis after being worked into Sequoia National Forest for a hike.  The aroma continues this theme.  Much of the scent is pepper tree and cedar.  However, the scent is so sweet in its woodiness, that there is even some over-ripe berry and musky earth, turning it sour in the end.  I was pleased by how this indica smoked.  It wasn’t harsh at all, and it had fine moments when it was like balsam or sandalwood incense.  Everything about the aesthetic side of this weed reminded me of northern California.  \n\nThe high of Redwood Kush is noticeably indica, meaning it exists mostly in the body.  I prefer the cerebral effects of sativas and sativa hybrids, and don’t often donate for pure indicas.  However, Redwood is a breezy body high that is perfect for minor aches and pains.  It helped ease my arthritis and shoulder pain considerably, but did little for a migraine I came down with one night.  I also enjoyed this strain because there is no couch lock, no laziness, and no drowsy yawning.  This was the most dynamic indica I’ve smoked, since coming to Southern California, and it is perfect as a sunny daytime medication.  \n\nhttp://ocweedreview.wordpress.com/","strain":"redwood-kush","user":"OCWeedReview","stars":"3.5","date":"2/1/2014 7:35 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Tingly","Happy","Pine","Woody"],"ID":"124244"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"aweedsnob","stars":"5","date":"2/1/2014 8:03 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Energetic","Focused","Relaxed","Uplifted"],"ID":"124245"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Perfect strain for around mid afternoon use.

I was on morphine, clonopin, gabapentin, and a slew of SSRIs for almost 3 years like a zombie, sick and not getting better. This particular breed is very effective. I did a cold turkey of ALL meds then after that storm I tried some marijuana from a fellow vet who recommended it. Its was outdoor and really made me overly paranoid. So I tried a few others, and if you are suffering anxiety and panic from PTSD this is not a cure, but it works great compared to the side effects of \"conventional\" medicine. My zero to 100 on panic and anger have been governed to a point where I can spend all day with my 5 and 2 year olds solo and not lose my shit, which was a huge thing for me.
