Consistently yielding THC levels between 25 and 28%, this hybrid has won countless awards for its overall high and potency. Now bred by GG Seeds, this strain was created on accident. A hermaphrodite Chem Sis plant pollinated some Sour Dubb. While the hermied plant was tossed, some of the resulting seeds were saved. From those seeds sprouted the Gorilla Glue family. Gorilla Glue #4 is the most impressive of all the offspring. So impressive that it won Best Hybrid in the 2014 Michigan and Los Angels High Times Cannabis Cup. It also took home awards from the Jamaican World Cannabis Cup. In some dispensaries, Gorilla Glue #4 has crossed the 30% THC benchmark. It has been growing in popularity ever since. The high from Gorilla Glue delivers heavy sativa and indica effects, though it's often thought to be sativa-dominant. Expect a strong wave of relaxation, coupled with intense cerebral activity. Overall, however, this strain provides both medical and recreational users with a happy, relaxed, and sleepy vibe. You may find yourself a little hungry, so make sure you've got some snacks on hand. Gorilla Glue #4 is best for late afternoon or evening. Medical users tend to like this strain for chronic pain. Cancer patients and those with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder have reported positive results from Gorilla Glue. Other pain-related conditions may benefits as well, such as arthritis, back injury, and fibromyalgia. Of course, some just like this potent hybrid for its ability to knock out stress after a few puffs.", "negative-effects": "DizzinessDry EyesDry Mouth", "strain": "gorilla-glue-4", "effects": " CerebralCreativityDrowsinessEuphoriaHappinessHungerRelaxationUplifting", "helps": "AnxietyArthritisCancerCrampsFibromyalgiaInsomniaLack Of AppetitePainPMSStress"},
