It has some body effects too, with a general relaxed feeling. No jitteriness like some Sativas. I didn't make me sleepy, but I don't think it would prevent me from sleeping either. It took care of most of my nausea without causing intense munchies. I did get a slight headache on comedown but nothing serious. Overall  I really like this strain.

They were out of Berry White, but recommended Honeyberry and Cherry Pie as similar strains that would be relaxing, but euphoric without any couchlock or tiredness. I wasn't able to find any information online about Honeyberry, but The Apothecarium described it as \"a cross between Honeycomb Haze and Blueberry Yum Yums.

I am bipolar and there are times when I feel myself slipping into Mania.  Typically I would just have to ride it out and apologize to my wife and friends when the mania ends.

This has ALWAYS been the hardest thing about being bipolar....becoming manic  and losing control and seeing the trail of destruction I leave behind me has been devastating.  But this strain....it takes me from manic to normal in 5 minutes.  The first time I tried it, I was about 3 hours into mania and I was saying a lot of mean things to my wife.  I felt like I was having an out of body experience and I couldn't feel empathy, love....anything.  That's when she told me to go smoke and come back.  (Weed is still a new form of medication for me.  I HATE chemical drugs and will let that be a last resort....).  \n\nSo I did....when I came back, I felt 100% normal.  I was horrified by my actions and was able to see the monster I became.  I must have apologized 100 times....I felt so removed from my mania that I could clearly see my actions for how destructive they were.  Mania always takes out all emotion and love from me....when I smoked this strain....it's like everything returned to normal.  \n\nWe ended up talking and crying together for the next hour as we worked out a lot of my problems with ways to prevent this from happening in the future.  \n\nLook, I have an amazing, loving wife to which I am extremely blessed.  But and I have always seen being bipolar as this dark side that is such a burden to the ones I love.  This strain changes everything.  I thank God for this strain....you have no idea how much stability it has brought back into my life.  \n\nJust an hour ago, I felt myself feeling manic, so I smoked from my pen and like it has in the past, it cut everything I was feeling and brought me back to normal.  It also allows me to work like I normally would.  I am still sharp and focused...I'm not wanting to pass out or in a state of couch lock.  I was thinking about how there has to be others out there like me who need help and I wanted to share my joy.  \n\nGod Bless you guys....\n\n**I vape this strain from an O-Pen.

Highly potent, she'll hit you in one or two tokes. And you'll feel her effects immediately. I felt them as much in my head as in my body -- perhaps atypical of an Indica-dominant strain.

My sense of time slowed to a crawl. Everything was groovy. The effects lasted for at least two or three hours before I drifted off into a very restful sleep.\n\nAesthetically, Ingrid is an interesting strain. Its flowers are packed and packed with trichomes, which will vary from milky to amber, in different proportion, depending upon harvest time and curing. The smell is, shall we say, idiosyncratic. I smelled musk, faint citrus, and sharply cured cheese. Others have claimed to smell \"dog poop.\" Talk to anyone who's encountered Ingrid, and they'll give you a slightly different, but no less creative description.

The smell and taste make this one worthy of notice in itself. The effects are kind of loopy and unfocused, no doubt from the haze side. \n\nThe batch I'm reviewing is decent. The nugs are very small, almost popcorn sized. The color is light green mottled with slightly darker green with red/orange hairs throughout. The smell is very sweet, with floral and fruit undertones. To me it smells more like faded strawberry than melon. Vaping it, produced a medium vapor, with the smell carrying on, for the most part, to the taste. The effects begin after about five minutes and hit with a unfocused, loopy effect. Mostly cerebral, not a lot of body effects, except for a general feeling of relaxation. Didn't make me sleepy or unusually hungry. Effects are similar to Amnesia Haze. Not my favorite, but not unpleasant under the right circumstances. I think this would be good for relaxing in the evening and watching a funny movie.

By the end, the last draw was more like dried wheat and toasted tobacco but not at all scratchy.   \n\nI would say that this strain is a pretty solid 9.5 and this particular example is perhaps a 9.8.\n\nSo now, a little about the high:\n\nThe first 15 minutes feel like \"oh yeah... I can feel this stuff working\" \n\nHighlights of this section include a moderately light high and an \"emotional zeroing\" effect similar to True OG.  You don't feel happy or uplifted, I would say it's more of a 'smart' high. \n\nThe second part of the high is \"My body feels amazing!\"\n\nThe second part is a very intense high that endures for about 40 minutes before it starts to subside.

Once broken up the smell seems to reverse from sour to sweet mostly, as those good good cooks come through and punch you in the face with terpenes. Its a real battle of terps here as the funky chem clashes with the sweetness of the cooks. Appearance is ridiculously wonderful, nearly looks wet with THC. It really glistens in the light! Taste upon the exhale is all sorts of dried fruit and nuts, then comes the chemmy, fuel-y funk with a hint of lime at the end just for fun. Again, ridiculous and then some.

If it is the real OG it should expand your lungs greatly(also depends on how you inhale it). I had no problem coughing while smoking this. It also didn't take long for me to feel the high either. I was Dan near stoned after just 1-2 hits no bs. I got done extreme Munchies, I killed a big family size of Doritos, a Huge Steak Burrito, and some Frosted Flakes. Everything was so fucking mellow.

A nice choice for anyone with a very high tolerance. The high itself is a wonderful combination of a very heady, yet mellowing high. It's a relaxing, smile inducing, and eyelid drooping kind of high, without a lot of the couch lock and laziness that usually comes with it.

Regular medicators will get used to the \"buzz\".","strain":"jamaican-lion","user":"Orbweaver","stars":"5","date":"9/15/2014 4:48 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Focused","Hungry","Creative","Relaxed","Flowery"],"ID":"211437"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"larry-og","user":"MichiganAGrade","stars":"5","date":"9/15/2014 5:39 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Happy","Uplifted","Relaxed","Citrus","Woody","Pine","Pungent"],"ID":"211438"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"vanilla-kush","user":"MichiganAGrade","stars":"5","date":"9/15/2014 5:54 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Energetic","Creative","Happy","Uplifted","Vanilla","Grapefruit","Flowery","Pungent","Spicy/Herbal"],"ID":"211439"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Nice and fruity smelling and tasting.

Sort of like a calmer but just as energizing adderall high.\n\nI wouldn't say the flower prompted the <i>most</i> creative or revelatory thoughts and feeling; rather, it greatly facilitated a predominantly deductive type of reasoning and also made such reasoning feel warmer and more gregarious than it generally does.\n\nThe closest strain to Flo that I've experienced is Durban Poison. True to its reputation, however, Durban Poison was even more heady and less bodily than Flo. And while a quickened mental pace may be shared in common between the two, the kind of mental clarity with Flo was much greater for me than with DB.\n\nThe high lasted for about 3 hours and I felt no hangover the next day.\n\nIn short, I would highly recommend this strain to anyone who enjoys thinking and conversing deeply.","strain":"flo","user":"Pharmakon","stars":"4.5","date":"9/15/2014 4:03 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Energetic","Euphoric","Focused","Hungry","Happy","Uplifted"],"ID":"211470"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Great!","strain":"sfv-og-kush","user":"MichiganAGrade","stars":"5","date":"9/15/2014 5:25 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy","Citrus","Lemon"],"ID":"211471"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Taste is Amazing!","strain":"blueberry","user":"Mikeytheduffer","stars":"4","date":"9/15/2014 7:39 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Berry"],"ID":"211473"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Creative and social, Strawberry Satori is my go-to strain for mildly-energizing daytime anxiety relief.

I really enjoyed it and I tend to choose indicas for my pain rather than sativas or hybrids. The genetics on this strain are White Widow mother and an Ice father. From my experiences with smoking White Widow it's a great social high but in order for it to have pain relieving properties it needs to be dialed in. It looks like great results with the White Castle strain. On first glance, the buds are frosty with the best bud structure. If you're looking for a white widow strain that packs a punch look no further. The buds are a much better shape than most of the white widow I have seen. This strain is very therapeutic. Not necessarily for patients with SCI although it does alleviate some discomfort. I could see this strain helping people with anxiety, PTSD, and even bipolar. This isn't a racy sativa/hybrid like others where patients who suffer from anxiety might have increased anxiety. I experience a bit of anxiety due to stress and pain but luckily this strain is very relaxing. \n\nThe aroma and flavor with these buds good enough to get my business again. It's seriously one of the best hybrids I have had in a while. It doesn't hit me as hard as a heavy kush or other strong indicas. I wasn't expecting to be KO'd by it but this felt like a great strain to smoke to unwind after a busy, tiring day of work. It's a great social strain and I think it has the potential to be a very popular top dollar strain.","strain":"3b32ff03-fd6c-4772-b563-6b939d343460","user":"Sapperton_Kush","stars":"4","date":"9/16/2014 5:55 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Energetic","Euphoric","Uplifted","Giggly","Relaxed","Pineapple","Tobacco","Chestnut","Skunk","Cheese","Lemon"],"ID":"212138"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This is Death Bubba by the breeder JT trees.

It helps the fibromyalgia pain as well as the anxiety caused by both PTSD and Bi-polar disorder. I am praying that PTSD will be given as a legitimate reason to use medical marijuana.

As I progressed into my 30s the flashbacks started and were horrible. Marijuana helped me deal with what was happening along with counseling. I stopped using pot when I was in 1999 but continued using prescription psychiatric meds to deal with my symptoms as well as pain meds, muscle relaxers, etc. Last year I went back to marijuana and when I was able to financially I got my medical marijuana card and as a result have gotten off three psychiatric meds. I still take two. Pills have caused me to have liver issues, weight gain, and other problems. I am grateful that Arizona voters saw the need for medical marijuana and voted to pass the use into law.

They have a pretty impressive resume of strains they've introduced to the cannabis community like Space Queen, Jack the Ripper and Querkle just to name a few. And this one might be their best. I had read about this strain on the TGA website and found it most alluring. I was browsing the menu at Spectrum caregivers and much to my pleasure I saw they were carrying this particular strain. Without any trepidation I purchased an eighth and was on my way to embark upon the discovery of Jesus...OG that is. First I must say the purveyor of this strain did an exceptional job of growing it. Expert technique from what I could discern from the buds I obtained. Perfectly cured and trimmed. A cross of Hell's Angel OG and Jack the Ripper we are bestowed with a most potent and tasty strain. Spherical buds encased in gleaming trichomes and soft orange hairs carry more of the aesthetics of the Jack side of the family then the OG side. The OG most certainly presents it self in the intoxicating aroma. A mash up of citrus and strawberries colliding with mint and fresh pine permeate through the room once the jar is open. Upon inhalation it's at first spicy and almost astringent with immense lung expansion. The exhale reveals the OG mother with pine and fresh earth dancing on the tongue. The high sets in almost immediately wrapping itself around your eyes and forehead. After couple of minutes it envelops the entire body wrapped in it's narcotic and soothing blanket. As sedated as the body is laziness is not a word I'd associate with this strain. The head is heavy but alert and lucid. I could feel pure elation wash over me leaving my face adorned in a smile. I wouldn't say this is a 'working mans' strain, though one with a more seasoned tolerance could most certainly complete tasks but I feel like this strain is best suited for more leisurely activities where one can be in the moment and mindful. This is one of if not the best strain I've had the pleasure of consuming. If you have the pleasure of finding Jesus you'll know the true meaning of blessed.","strain":"jesus-og","user":"notmycrayons","stars":"5","date":"9/20/2014 6:12 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Uplifted","Relaxed"],"ID":"215195"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Less focus\nMore calming high\nSome euphoria and body high\nRelaxing tunes and stress free activities\nNot good for critical interactions\nObstructs thought process","strain":"dutch-treat","user":"tpetz2","stars":"3","date":"9/20/2014 6:37 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Hungry","Euphoric","Relaxed"],"ID":"215196"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"dutch-treat","user":"CheySummer","stars":"4","date":"9/20/2014 7:23 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Talkative","Happy","Uplifted"],"ID":"215197"},{"_type":"dict","content":"a 1","strain":"romulan","user":"dongoddess","stars":"0","date":"9/20/2014 8:27 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"215199"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Sale Shatter $30 gm .

I really, really, really like this stuff. It grew easily. Had a mildew problem. This plant resisted better than any of the other strains growing. While flowering, the smell wasn't too strong, pretty easy to conceal if you just had one or two growing at home. It smelled like lemon Pledge and Bazooka Joe bubblegum... it's a weird combo, imagine smelling freshly cut lemongrass while chewing on that powdery pink gum you'd find in packs of hockey/baseball cards... that's very close. Not really my favourite smell but I can see how some would probably like this a lot. \n\nOverall, probably among the best weed I've smoked. No skunk/cat pee smell in here at all. Very easy smell to conceal if you'd have to try. Very sativa effect after about 10 minutes what feels like nothing. At first, you don't feel very high... but it guilds and builds. I feel pressure behind the eyes and a dry mouth. Energized but also relaxed (not sleepy). This stuff actually does a good job waking you up... like espresso coffee. I do feel my heart beating kinda faster but it isn't bad at all and it eases-up after another 10 minutes. No paranoia. This stuff always brings me to a wonderful place. Makes me feel so empathetic, happy, a little silly, playful and giggly. There is lots of euphoria in this high... feels like I could burst out laughing if someone would do something silly. This stuff will put a grin on your face and it will leave you functional... but I know I probably couldn't drive while on this. People around you will probably notice you are high when you're on this magical stuff. This weed doesn't make me hungry nor does it make me horny HOWEVER I just know that things like eating would feel good... so would listening to music... dancing would feel quite nice when on this. As for sex, this stuff makes me feel sensual rather than horny. Yeah... makes you want to have that \"tantric\" sort of sex. Generally speaking... this stuff accentuates pleasure, whatever that pleasure may be. \n\nOne thing I wish this didn't do so well is destroy short-term memory. It's a very \"having your keys in your hand while you're looking for them... all while forgetting what you were looking for in the first place\" kinda weed.

Look up shark by CBD seeds on seedfinder.eu there's a killer pic. I get the MK at a reasonable price. In other words, medical grade for less than the dispensaries. The catch is I'm caught in the grower's growth cycles. For anybody who's never heard of or had MK Ultra. It's G 13 x OG kush. In not so many words it's a powerful indica, doesn't quite put you to sleep but it relaxes you. The G 13 genetics provide bigger buds I believe and the OG kush is for the awesome flavour.

Touch is wonderfully heightened, inducing surges of intense pleasure. One of the absolute best - and almost downright overwhelming - for sexy time. Still quite, quite high after a surprisingly long while. Goddamn, this is a good come down. Still perfectly positive with no slump or crash. Still could do something if energy required. Really feel part of a place. Good for atmospheric and moody environments. Concerts, I'm sure. Of the close to a hundred different strains I've tried, this is likely the best.

I purchased some from Spectrum Caregivers in Los Angeles, and I'm so happy to report that this is the PERFECT strain for me!  \n\nI was a little worried before I smoked it as I've gotten too high before and it's not fun.  Within a couple of minutes of smoking the flower, I felt an incredible happiness and inner peace.  I felt a mild head buzz, but it was absolutely clear and anxiety-free.  My body felt so good... all the tension I have in my shoulders seemed to melt away (I still don't feel any tension right now, a whole day later without smoking it again) and my stomach felt warm and \"loose\".  I haven't been able to sleep very well since I quit smoking cigarettes 3 weeks ago, and it gave me the best night's rest I've had since I quit. \n\nI would recommend this to any beginner or someone who is looking to quell anxiety problems.

Pretty classic: about a foot tall, normal sized downstem, no percs, but it did have ice catchers. We went onto his deck and smoked 3 decent sized bowls. It's probably worth mentioning both of us were breaking a dry spell of about 2.5 months...\n\nI was downstairs in his basement washing the bong out and I was chill. I was high as balls, but I was chill. My buddy comes flying down the stairs completely tweaked screaming that he's not ok. This freaked me out, but I was able to calm him down and get him upstairs to his living room.\n\nWe ordered chinese food (by some miracle I didn't make an ass of myself ordering it) and we sat down to eat. I told him that if he ate he would feel better, and I remember not being super hungry and kinda picking at my chicken and broccoli while watching him devour his order of sesame chicken, pork dumplings, and for some reason, milk.\n\nWe were on the couch in his living room watching Aziz Ansari (who is funny as shit when you're stoned) and he's still tweaking. I reached over and tried to calm him down, at which point he stands up and proceeds to vomit up the insane amount of chinese food and milk he just consumed all over the persian rug. \n\nHe throws up for a little while and I finally manage to comprehend the situation and get him into the bathroom. He finishes puking while I figure out the best course of action to get this shit off the rug before his parents find out and kill him.\n\nIt took me 2 different vacuum cleaners, a full roll of paper towels, a half bottle of seltzer, and about an hour and a half to clean up the vomit. I was stoned shitless the whole time, so 1.5 hours is kind of impressive.  Eventually, the only evidence was a faint stain. My friend was completely shot, so like all good friends would do I brought him up to his room, got him to brush his teeth, change his clothes, and into bed. Then I went downstairs, smoked the rest of his weed, finished the Aziz standup, and raided his fridge.

Haze is almost an entire branch of Sativa genetics of its' own - instead of the 'speed and tight head' feeling of a pure sativa like Durban Poison, Haze genetics tend to produce an uplifting/soaring/euphoric high rising from the chest.  Wonderful daytime smoke with no crash and immediate effects that continue building long after you've smoked; paranoia and excess energy are common, but sativa smokers know that going into it ... it's almost part of the quality of the high.\n\nThe sample I currently have has the typical light-green/grey/silver look that you'd expect, with a healthy coating of trichomes - giving it a frosted  silvery look.  Lots of kief which is evident upon grinding - the herb looks even more white/silvery when ground.  The smell of the ground herb is a sandlewood-spice type smell with a little bit of flowery/citrus undertones - but generally that spicy-greeny smell that all good Haze tends to have (no skunk, cheese, fuel, kush, pineapple, etc.).\n\nThe smoke burns quickly and pops immediately in the lungs - you can feel the THC hit the lungs, travel to the brain/bloodstream, and down the legs before you even blow the hit our.  It leaves you with a really uplifting, rising/building high that feels like the first waves of LSD ... even breathing feels good, your nose might run a bit, you feel alert and energized from your chest to your brain.  The smell/taste when smoked is hashy and spicy - fairly easy on the throat but expansive in the lungs ... leaving a sandlewood-hash type taste on the tongue.  The high lasts 2+ hrs for me off of less than .5g - and I'm an everyday smoker!

My ability to focus was completely shot, which made EVERYTHING boring. I mean... My attention would waver because nothing was interesting enough to HOLD my attention. So I'd just be sitting there, wanting to do something, but the only thing I could actually ENJOY was eating or sleeping. If your sole reason to smoke is to marvel at the wonders of fantastic fucking food, or to sleep, then I'd say this is the strain for you. Also, if doing nothing while you're couchlocked is fun, then go for it. But other than those three things, there's not much going for this stuff. Made me want to do something but anything I came up with was boring. Which, basically, is the same shit I do sober because of my apathy due to depression. So this stuff really isn't good for depression, I think. I can't figure out if it's the strain itself or if it's making me more aware of my depression, so people with depression, please be cautious.\n\nTalking with friends isn't so bad, but it's not as fun as it could be with sativa.\n\nPretty ok for anxiety, in the sense that things don't affect you as easily as they normally would, but it doesn't completely get rid of anxiety, if you normally have it. Nevertheless, it does ease some anxious thoughts you might normally have. Probably because it's indica. Indica is usually pretty good about that stuff. Basically the thoughts don't go away, but the physical symptoms of anxiety (shaking, alertness, sweating, jumpiness), as well as any OCD-like compulsions to check things are significantly reduced. The thoughts, I think, would need to be fixed through therapy, but this stuff seems to do very well with easing anxiety symptoms. It's almost as good as anti-anxiety drugs in this sense. So if you prefer weed in a purely medicinal way and you have anxiety, then this stuff is also pretty good for that, I noticed.\n\nAlso works pretty well for muscle tension headaches, which may suggest either reduced pain or reduced stress, though I'm leaning more towards the pain side of things, since muscle tensions don't shally go away THAT fast once you relax yourself.\n\nOverall, I give it 3 whole stars because the medicinal effects are fucking fantastic.... On the other hand, I only give it 3 stars because that's really all this stuff seems to have going for it.","strain":"blueberry-kush","user":"teaquicks","stars":"3","date":"10/2/2014 8:42 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Sleepy","Relaxed","Hungry","Talkative","Giggly"],"ID":"221333"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I like it a lot.

This strain has been bred for decades in Nor Cal with various names for the supposed \"true, original phenotype\" (Arcata or \"E-32 cut\" or \"707 cut\" cut etc etc) based on the supposed lineage - but no matter which cut you get there are certain elements that make this strain so easily identifiable - it has one of the most pungent, sweet & spicy, CRAZY smells.  The smell is very much in line with Oaxacan / Mexican Sativa that is part of the lineage, most landrace Mexican strains have a very \"spicy\" quality to the terpene profile. The buds are often a lighter green color, sometimes even bordering on a yellowish-gray hue, a really unique tone. The high is usually very sativa-dominant depending on the harvest, as long as it's not let go too long. Great strain, a classic with classic genetics.  It's a bit of a pain to grow and doesn't yield exceptionally well, which almost makes it more of a connosieur strain in my eyes, but it's still all over the clubs here in CA priced the same as everything else.

Okay. I will try to write this review for a fourth time. *angry face*\n\nI purchased Farmer J's famous kush because I was looking for a nice indica to put me to sleep. This stuff was labeled as an indica and I was told at the shop I got it from that it would put me in my a$$. So, 2 grams and $56 later, I'm out the door to go run some errands. As I'm waiting in a parking lot, I decided to go to the Farmer J's website (farmerjs.com) and read about their inventory. As I'm reading, I come across the famous kush; which says \"sativa dominant hybrid\". Hmm   So, I go back to the shop where I got my goods and inquired about the discrepancies. I was told that the Farmer J's site's information was incorrect and that it is an indica. \nLater that evening, I smoked a bowl so I could get some sleep. Hah! No sleep for this gal. Actually, it was quite the opposite effect. Not cool for someone with insomnia. Needless to say, I got zero sleep.  \nAnyhow, I decided that following day that I would try it for day time use. Super awesome stuff!  I felt energized, motivated and overall, good. My mood was elevated, I was talkative and just enjoyed life. I had very little brain fog. \nI know this may not seems like a big deal to you, but for the past 6 years, I have suffered terribly with deep depression, anxiety and terrible moodiness. After I smoked, I felt like my old self again! I felt human again. \nThe high was great. There's really not much of a flavor/taste and it's smooth as hell. No coughing. Not even a small one. In fact, I didn't even think I was getting anything in my lungs until I blew out. Hah!\nSo, yes I would recommend this, but not for when you're trying to sleep.","strain":"3255dc9c-f247-4f1f-8334-0abaf7f2004c","user":"wendik82","stars":"5","date":"10/3/2014 12:09 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Energetic","Focused","Happy","Relaxed","Talkative","Uplifted","Sweet","Earthy","Spicy/Herbal","Pepper","Skunk"],"ID":"221773"},{"_type":"dict","content":"one of my favorites just had some shatter from THC that had awesome flavor I'm sure it was an example of full terpine extraction","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"erika9950","stars":"5","date":"10/3/2014 6:43 PM","attributes":["Edible ","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Focused","Happy","Tingly","Uplifted","Sweet","Citrus","Lemon","Flowery","Earthy","Diesel"],"ID":"221774"},{"_type":"dict","content":"great strain. relaxing feel. great before a nap. or perhaps end the day.

I wish TGA Subcool would make this the highlight of their seed bank, because it is a Rockstar! If you suffer from severe chronic and acute pain, especially spinal pain, and have trouble sleeping at night, make sure to try this!

Well earned, perhaps. The air of Valencia or Navel oranges delivers acidity between the nostrils, presenting an almost food-like salivation when grinding, or sampling straight from the packaging. The smoke carries a light, lofty taste of citrus into the throat and will be felt within minutes as it begins to silence tension throughout the body. This indica-dominant strain may be felt primarily in the body, as the patient finds themselves deeply relaxed however conversational for at least some time. For those needing to keep their head in the game, Tangerine Kush remains a quality option for early evening hours when patients have returned from work, but still need to carry out the rest of their day.","strain":"tangerine-kush","user":"xkingeddiex","stars":"5","date":"10/6/2014 8:48 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Talkative","Giggly","Relaxed","Uplifted","Citrus","Orange","Lemon"],"ID":"222871"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This has got to be my favorite strain of all the strains that I have got.

That can be somewhat intense, but is mostly tempered by overwhelming and near flawless elation!\n\nCompared to other strains, this does have an EXTRA amount of feel-good emotions. There's a lightness of mood and blissful contentedness with anything and everything. It's a rather unique and special uplifted feeling that no other strain quite delivers - especially for such potency and length.\n\nVisuals may be some of my favorite of any strain. The narrow focus constantly makes everything compelling and colors feel like they're exploding at you. \n\nThere is a downside in that it has a fairly noticeable physical drain. Both times I've vaped while walking and within 10-15 mins felt physically tired. This impacts the social aspect, as well. Multiple times my friends would become quiet - although, it never felt bad - just more comfortable to absorb things personally than make the effort to communicate. It wasn't HARD to talk, just not what this high excels at. Would probably be best for road trips and low-energy activities (video games, art, etc.)\n\nI do have to give top marks for the come-down. Despite the mild exhaustion, it actually dissipates with more euphoria than heaviness. Leaving you on cloud 9, with a rosy, top-of-the-world outlook on life for hours afterwards. May be one of the best ever for anti-depression.","strain":"euphoria","user":"weazal","stars":"3.5","date":"10/7/2014 2:12 AM","attributes":["Concentrate ","Creative","Euphoric","Focused","Happy","Relaxed","Uplifted","Lime"],"ID":"222974"},{"_type":"dict","content":"The taste is out of this world!

It begins with that orange zest mentioned in the strain details, and then the high explodes from the back of my head to my lungs, only to zip through the rest of my body like goosebumps, or a chill. This sudden onset might not affect everyone, but I love this strain for when I need to calm down. You can't well be sad or pissed off when all you want to do is get the Earth back on its axis. \n\nIn addition to the almost immediate effects, the high gets more smooth and provides enough sedation for a solid 8 hours of sleep. \n\nOn the negative side, my metabolism is trashed (thanks, genetics) and this is a potent, long-lasting strain. The sedation carries into the morning, so I have trouble waking up after a night of smoking this. But I have hypothyroidism, so my experience may differ from yours.\n\nOverall: My favorite strain thus far. My favorite Tucson dispensary (Green Halo!) called it their strongest, next to Larry OG — both testing above 20% THC. This sits up next to Matt's No. 1 OG, which blew my head apart every time I smoked (or drank, vaped, or ate) it.","strain":"casey-jones","user":"carnie43","stars":"5","date":"10/8/2014 12:33 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Focused","Giggly","Happy","Relaxed","Uplifted","Sweet","Orange","Pungent","Skunk","Pine"],"ID":"223468"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Sour Diesel is probably my favorite strain!

Let me call it God's Cock. A tall and wide, large leafed plant with  bright green colour. I grew it in the Queensland rainforest a ten years ago to see how much one plant could produce. At ten feet tall I cut the top down to head height as it was far from mature in the Summer. At fifeteen odd feet I cut that back and trimmed all of the lower branches off to avoid diseases of the soil from getting into the lower limbs. At eight months I was worried about being busted for such a lage grow op and harvested a couple weeks early with trics just turned dark on fifty percent of the fuller heads.I harvested about five pound per plant but I didn't have the fascilities to exactly measure. The dried heads were semi sticky as I cured them roughly laying the whole plant on the tarpaulins I had spread in the direct sun. This was  after quickly running my hands down the long branches with leaf and heads coming away only with much effort. Say the whole plant was very hardy and tough.  Then I redried that product in a warn dark room a couple days later after it sat in plastic garbage bags .  A lot turned to powder and yet I still had about 5 pound per plant. As the plants were all mixed up during the drying I had to keep a fair selection of that seed and try to reproduce the best heads setting plants. Which were quick to sprout again a couple of months later. Everybody I gave some smoke to, thought it was a bloody bottler and worth keeping for the taste. Because of the curing process it burned like a firecracker and left a harsh throat effect. But when the smell got past the curing, the punter knew this was the real mc Coy. The stone came on immediately and just got stronger. I was an heavy blaster myself and smoked a dessert bowl per day while harvesting all day and night but even I was smashed off my tits after a few cones. The initiate would just be floored at two cones, big one , I admit. I took out a couple of braggarts with that gras. I still have some of the seeds off a later crop grown from the original God's Cock. I was given those original seeds by a friend who started with me in the rainforest but died from an overdose of heroin, stupid stupid. He traded mean clean green for a batch of dirty white and paid the price. It is in Brad's Honour that I named it God's Cock for he was a prize prick for leaving me to grow such a large crop . I needed help which turned up when two fellow bushwalkers stumbled into camp one morning. It turned out that I knew one's brother from jail. Co-incidence?

And I'm going to give OGShark a 4 Star. And here's why. \n\nFor new users: if you're really looking to be mind blown, this is for you. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend trying this right off the bat it's pretty potent. I used this product in a volcano vape. A small amount goes a long ways. If you're using this, I'd recommend starting small and just adding as you go. The taste was a bit harsh on the back of the throat so of all the weeds I've tried, it helps with something to drink with. It has a bit of a smell, and if smell is a bit of an issue for you - I'd recommend some inscents for sure. The reason I'm giving it for stars was because it was incredibly potent and it does hit you like a shark creep up. The high in the beginning was quite mellow but then I had a tiny bit of tingling and a huge head buzz. I also ended up getting a headache from this strain (But that could be just me). It's a head and body buzz with a strong head high. The weed is full of crystals and the potency was 24.0% for THC. If you don't enjoy that mega high feeling - stay away. \n\nModerate plus tokers: if you love the head high and the body buzz and a creeper this is definitely for you. It's smooth sailing and then bam - it hits you in the head like a truck. \n\nI didn't find it arousing or creative like it claimed. My head was killing me. But all and all if you like that stuff it does exactly what it explains - Potent!\n\nWasn't for me but everyone else enjoy!","strain":"og-shark","user":"CriticalYoda","stars":"4","date":"10/10/2014 12:22 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Anxious","Headache","Tingly","Dry Mouth","Dizzy","Paranoid"],"ID":"224496"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I heard that Dutch Treat was a dank strain, so I rolled a couple spliffs with my buddy.

I'm going to break down my review for users who are new and curious to this strain and more moderate weed enthusiasts. \n\nNew Users: If you enjoy the stoned feeling, this weed could be for you. The taste is rather mild. I did this with a volcano vape. Small quantities go a long way. If you enjoy getting really \"messed up\" this would be ideal with higher quantities. The high is quite mellow, but I couldn't concentrate at all. You're so relaxed once it kicks in (I vaped slowly and it took about 15-20min.) to set in. The set in is more or less just your body is forced into a relaxed state and everything's much calm and mellow. It's a sweeter taste of many weed strains. It doesn't have a harsh tone/vape feel. Using the volcano, other than a small smell at the beginning taking the piece off the volcano, your room won't smell much - if at all since it doesn't have that slinky scent. If you don't enjoy getting \"head/body high\" and THC potent things are not for you, feel free to stay away from this strain and try a lower strain or high-CBD strain.  \n\nModerate Smokers: if you enjoy mellow, and getting high on a higher THC strain this is as mellow as it gets! It sets in slowly and it's really just a relaxer if anything. Taste isn't bad like mentioned earlier. \n\nTHC: 22.7% (Tilray was great. I ordered and it came in 2 days after the order was placed. Zero damaged goods and nothing was wrong with the product) \n\nI don't enjoy the high feeling as much as others. So for me, I wouldn't rate it favourable since I'm a more low THC OR HIGH-CBD user but for the review of the product - it's a rather great weed for those who need a relaxer type weed so I'm rating it based on what it's for not personal use. \n\nPersonal (someone not interested in getting mega high) 3 - tolerable.  But all and all, 5 stars across the board.

Writing for new users and medical users with experience. First off, this is potent. And I mean potent. I'm not someone who ever gets the munchies or ever gets giggly - and it did both.\n\nif you like having something that will give you the munchies - this is for you. When I used this I had the munchies, severe to moderate body tingling everywhere. The more you vape/toke the more strong the tingles. And it's everywhere from your toes to your brain. I used it with the volcano vape. This strain fascinated me. For me it was far too potent since I don't enjoy tingling and wasn't expecting to be that high - but it didn't smell like weed at all. It had a slight weed scent but it was covered by a heavy floral smell. Almost as though it was incense. It tastes like a floral tea when you vape it, and you don't need to worry about the smell in your room with this stuff. But man was I hungry and thirsty. I am not a medical patient for pain, but I did have an injury the week I received my batch - and I have severe runners knee. With this stuff, the swelling stayed but the pain was completely gone. I tried this for stress and insomnia, since I didn't enjoy the tingling - I was more stressed to have it wear off to fall asleep.

Then I got talkative, and by the looks on people's faces and the commentary of my wife I was not making much conventional sense.  Killed my appetite. A good meal was served & I did not want to eat.  Intoxication wore off in 4 hours.  But at my regular bedtime I had trouble falling asleep.\n\nComments: Would not recommend use for PTSD, anxiety, paranoia, bi-polar disease, schizophrenia.  Use may be good for emotional depression.  Creative folks may enjoy the effects while painting, writing, or performing improvisational music.  Personally this strain is not my preference.  I like the effects of indica to mentally relax, feel smooth & tension free.  I'll probably give away or trade my crop for another strain.","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"sonomavalleytom","stars":"3","date":"10/14/2014 10:33 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Energetic","Paranoid","Tea","Diesel"],"ID":"225189"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Mae's favorite","strain":"grapefruit","user":"Ejs3","stars":"5","date":"10/14/2014 10:40 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Euphoric","Energetic"],"ID":"225190"},{"_type":"dict","content":"A very excitable high.

What I am noticing with all of these different strains is that at first, because of the \"body high\" the pain is actually intensified. Odd but I think it's due to the fact that it's a \"body\" high so you become acutely aware of your whole body, for better or worse. Then, once you smoke enough, your are anesthetized and are so freaked out by the buzz that you forget about your pain. Once the initial paranoia subsides you will feel relief from your pain and you can get some much needed rest. \nI don't smoke this stuff for the euphoric effects as I don't find being stoned fun. I smoke because it relieves my pain and Tokyo gets the job done. I take a couple of puffs and wait about 10 minutes and then just hold on for the ride.

Music made it that much better and I was so alert and productive it was great. Maybe an hour into smoking I started to calm down and quick. Munchies hit me like a bitch and that was it. Sitting on the couch watching Netflix and eating a box of pizza was exactly what I wanted out of the smoke. Not exactly sleepy or couch-locked, just content with not moving lol.

The official genetics are listed as \"Strawberry Fields x Haze\" and it definitely does seem to have a haze element to it.  The Strawberry Fields strain is the mysterious one that nobody knows / says what its lineage is.  There is a bit of a comedown that leaves you a bit foggy, but if you smoke more that goes away (not necessarily convenient, having to continue smoking to stay \"up\").  Good giggly / talkative social vibe as well.  The original breeder Kyle Kushman sold the seed rights to this strain to Dutch Passion I believe, or another Dutch seedbank.  So there are at least 2 versions floating around - the \"clone only\" version circulating California where it originated, and the \"from-seed version\" that people are growing from the seed bank.

OG Kush may as well just be a synonym for good weed, like Chronic or Skunk, other strains that just became synonymous with \"good weed\" via rap and media.  OG Kush is essentially a strain with hundreds of different phenotypes and sub-crosses that all act a bit differently.  (Tahoe OG,Alien OG,Yoda OG,SFV OG,Ferrari OG,Bentley OG,Fire OG,Cherry OG, and on and on and on) And the only people who really know the genetics are the people who have been holding mother plants since the early 90's.  OG's are constantly falsely labeled, because they all smell so similar and people can get away with mis-labeling strains or just plain making names up.  For me?  They put my ass to sleep.  Pretty much all of them, unless they're crossed with a proper Sativa.  But it's great potent weed when you need something to put you to sleep. I don't know how people smoke kush all day.","strain":"og-kush","user":"spacejunkOG","stars":"4","date":"10/13/2014 1:47 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Creative","Euphoric","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy"],"ID":"225739"},{"_type":"dict","content":"grew the Sativa-dominant phenotype - terpene profile exactly as described, nice citrusy smell and diesel / skunk smell.

Light sweet and a lil minty. \n\n I have anxiety and suffer from panic attacks occassionally. I also suffer from Psoriasis. I researched this strain and felt it would work best for these two issues i deal with.\n\nIn the past, when i've vaped, \ni would end up with a panic attack. The strong body buzz would trigger an attack.  But the visual changes in my sight might have also caused me anxiety.  Unfortunately what was to be a relaxing time, just turned so sour so fast.  \n\nWith this strain, I am able to get the relaxation I need without the head high or body buzz that triggers my attacks.  The high cbd content and low THC is the perfect pairing if you have anxiety and want an anti-inflammatory and immune system regulator. It will keep you relaxed. I could function fine although I was sometimes a lil heavy-lidded.  \n\nThe effects didnt last long. 2 hours tops.  So I medicated often- wanted to keep the healing cbds in my body (:  Only time will tell if this helps cure my psoriasis.  i'll let you know if it does.\n\nGot my Cannatonic at Waterfall Wellness in SF.","strain":"cannatonic","user":"celestialheart99","stars":"5","date":"10/14/2014 5:14 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Happy","Relaxed","Sleepy","Sweet","Mint"],"ID":"225938"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I loved this and I'm so glad i was able to find the connect to get it.

Partial sun. Organic. Just one plant. 16 weeks from baby to harvest. Thick main stalk with 25 branches. Topped at 5 foot height.  Moderate yield. 100 grams of flowers.\n\nSmoke test: 5X. Paper cigarette and small water pipe. Flavor: Delightful!  Real strong fresh blueberry taste.  Smooth. Smokes easy, no irritation, no coughing.\n\nEffects: Classic Indica relaxation.  Relaxed mind and peaceful body. Sense of well being and that all is right with the world.  Calming. Euphoric.  No munchies, but encourages appetite for good food.  Almost immediate sensations after 1st inhale.  I have inhaled up to 8 times in a 15 minute span with diminishing returns.  Seems like effects do not get stronger after 4th or 5th inhale.  Effects do wear off quickly.  2 hours after last inhale, effects almost all gone.\n\nComments:  I like this strain for the flavor & effects.  Even if Blueberry had NO effects I'd probably still smoke it for the taste.  Do wish that the effects were more intense & longer lasting.\n\nRecommend: To treat anxiety, paranoia, restlessness, PTSD, bi-polar disease, lack of appetite and insomnia.","strain":"blueberry","user":"sonomavalleytom","stars":"4","date":"10/14/2014 10:55 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy","Relaxed","Sleepy","Blueberry","Violet"],"ID":"226067"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Shit had me smacked \n","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"KushGangKadoe","stars":"4","date":"10/15/2014 12:24 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"226068"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Loved it I grew some no regrets hear very smooth and tastes great ","strain":"lemon-kush","user":"bearman911","stars":"4","date":"10/15/2014 4:22 AM","attributes":["Topical ","Happy","Relaxed","Giggly"],"ID":"226069"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"bubba-kush","user":"JacktheRipper420","stars":"3","date":"10/15/2014 5:14 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"226070"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"grape-god","user":"JacktheRipper420","stars":"3","date":"10/15/2014 5:23 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"226071"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"east-coast-sour-diesel","user":"JacktheRipper420","stars":"4","date":"10/15/2014 5:26 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"226072"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Very good day-time use.

Partial sun. 5 plants. Harvest after 16 weeks. Plants remained puny, with ridiculously low yield.  Less than 10 grams dried flowers, 10 grams of dry leaf.\n\nSmoke test:  4:00pm. Combustion. Two times. Small water pipe.  Delightful sweet flavor, tastes like a natural fruit leather. Flavor lives up to the name.  Smooth, easy on lungs, no irritation, no coughing.\n\nEffects:  Inhaled thick smoke strongly 4 times in a 5 minute span.  Cerebral effects felt quickly.  Mild mind stimulation. Enhanced mental clarity. Enhanced alertness. Enhanced \nhappiness & good humor, but no silly laughing.  Comfortable perception that my local environment had expanded, like being outdoors even though I was in my dining room. Weird but nice. That said, my homegrown Candyland has much milder cerebral effect compared to other strains that I grew this year (Kush, Blueberry, Sour Diesel). No negative effects, No paranoia, No anxiety. Somatic effect also is mild. Gives a sense of calm well being.  Neither sleep inducing nor energizing. Energy level seemed unchanged from pre-smoke. Did not induce munchies. Mind & body effects both seemed to evaporate within 2 hours. Felt completely unmedicated, no hangover.\n\nComments: Disappointing grower in soil. Plants stayed short & puny. My babies were bought from a grower who starts plants in rock wool.  I did not cut the wool away from the roots as the plants were spindly and delicate.  Harvest yield was pitifully small.  Hardly worth my $40 investment for the 5 baby plants.\n\nRecommendations: If you're a home grower who wants better yield than mine I think that Candyland requires indoor hydroponic / sunlamp conditions.  I'm a rank amateur cannabis backyard grower for my own consumption. Though I have 50 years experience growing vegetables, fruits, shrubs & lawns. I will not try to grow this cannabis strain again.  If you \npurchase at a dispensary, expect a lightweight medicine that has mild cerebral and body effects. All pleasant effects, but short acting that fade quickly.  Potential good choice for a \ncannabis newbie who wants to start easy and smoke a mild & tasty strain.  Just do not expect to feel especially medicated.","strain":"candyland","user":"sonomavalleytom","stars":"2.5","date":"10/15/2014 6:28 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Happy","Relaxed","Uplifted","Focused","Apple","Pear","Rose"],"ID":"226142"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Excellent daytime Fibromyalgia pain and spasm relief without drowsiness.

Planted late in season. 5 plants. Clones. Grew to 40\" tall.  Covered in small sticky flowers from bottom to top. Copious dark green leaves.\n\nDried herb weighed out to: 600 grams of leaf & 200 grams of flowers.\n\nEffects: Potent.  Very cerebral.  Racing thoughts, caused some anxiety & paranoia. Moderate body effect (floating & out-of-body) but not relaxing, though no twitching.  I did not really enjoy the effects, as my preference is indica induced relaxation and mind calming. Did not increase appetite, actually had opposite effect.  I was served good food that I did not want to eat.\n\nDespite Leafly description that Sour Diesel is fast acting, my experience is that full effect after 2 combustion inhales took 20 minutes to fully kick-in.  I would not recommend inhaling more than 5 hits. On another occasion I did smoke 9 deep inhales in 6 minute span, got to the point of visual hallucinations that lasted 40 minutes.  7 hours later (my usual bedtime) I had trouble falling asleep.\n\nTaste:  Not as intense diesel fuel smell / taste that I read about.  More green, herbal.  Smoke is somewhat irritating to lungs.  Makes me cough.\n\nOverall:  Strong stuff. Not for use to help relaxation nor sleep.  Not recommended for anxiety, paranoia, bi-polar disease, PTSD.  Use for emotional / mental depression may be beneficial.

Smells like cannabis, albeit a mildly sweet variety, but I don't get rapturous about it smelling like fruit / flowers / fresh baked goods, etc, etc, etc...  My homegrown: Even smaller flowers, pretty triangular shape with a slight yellow / violet color and white sugar crystal dusting.

Medium body flavor. Mildly sweet. No acrid bite. Easy on the lungs, No coughing. \nRoom aroma is pretty strong with some skunk. Effects from 4 big inhales in a 5 minute span: Cerebral - Effect felt immediately and ramps up to peak within 15 minutes. Mind \nexpanding. Quiets internal chatter. Heavy skull sensation with tired eyes syndrome. I don't often use the silly term, but I feel \"stoned\". Moderately calming without immediate \nsleep inducton. Promotes appetite. No anxiety, No paranoia.  Body - Induces moderate calm. Seems to smooth out the nervous system. Very pleasant. Effect strength is pretty hefty even with a small amount used.

The nugs were perfection- dense, sticky, green with visible crystals. I got cotton mouth & the munchies like crazy, I haven't gotten the munchies in a while.

Looks are deceiving with this strain; it seems like your average, everyday mid-grade strain, but in reality it packs a clear-headed high that is perfect to wake and bake with. \n\nThe smoke is smooth, and generally pretty light (I say generally because it really does depend on the grower). The high is level headed and easy, nothing abrupt, violent or volatile about this strain.  It gently lifts you to the peak of the high, like a roller coaster slowly inching its way to the top.

I did however admire its peculiar qualities which seemed to involve a focus upon the mind without reference to emotional or evaluative content, but instead a distinct augmentation upon the functional aspects of attention and focus within real time so that extraneous stimuli could be managed with far less effort.  In fact, it seemed that I was watching myself NOT watching those stimuli, because I knew that normally I would have gotten tripped up on them in terms of making sense out of them or processing them in some way.\n\nI simply left those stimuli alone, and focused instead on what I was doing, a natural consequence of that because it in no way hampered my attention as such, but only my attention for certain stimuli which pertained to other people's behavior, something which for me tends to have a very symbolic nexus of potential meanings sheathed within it, and I'm sure others often project or express some content through such signals on the well-founded expectation or hope, or even in spite of the fear that they may be detected and interpreted by others.\n\nI could also detect, without undue distraction, the instances and degrees of intensity of others reaction to my lack OF reaction to their stimuli.  I was able to abstract the implications of all this without obsessive rumination, and constructively append thoughts, tactical appendices to various possible consequences of the status quo that was present, and act in a more resolute and sensible way.  \n\nClean and polished action resulting from focused attention unadulterated by extraneous and spurious input from the sensations, especially as they pertain to that knotty and thorny issue of interpersonal interaction.\n\nIn truth, however, I would probably not normally want to be in this state PER SE unless I were in need of taking care of some \"risky business\" involving either hard nosed diplomacy, or perhaps visceral action which required a certain psychological distance from the other persons or objects involved.  It seemed like a really benign augmentation to the tactical level of action, but mainly after the plan was made and there was to be no going back.\n\nThe loop between sensation and response was very tight, very centered on my own free will, and without a lot of free roaming thought or impulse toward perceptual investigation.  It strengthened the J aspect, but also strengthened the P aspect as well, in just such a way that it supported the T function already operating with the J parameters.","strain":"jupiter-og","user":"Metaentheologist","stars":"2.5","date":"10/19/2014 4:27 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Energetic","Focused","Hungry","Earthy","Chemical","Ammonia","Citrus","Lime"],"ID":"229359"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"maui-wowie","user":"XSEgo","stars":"0","date":"10/19/2014 5:09 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Creative","Giggly","Happy","Relaxed","Uplifted","Sweet","Tropical","Pineapple"],"ID":"229360"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"sfv-og","user":"XSEgo","stars":"0","date":"10/19/2014 5:19 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Citrus","Lemon","Woody","Pine"],"ID":"229361"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"rhijenkins","stars":"3","date":"10/19/2014 5:22 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Anxious","Aroused","Creative","Uplifted","Tingly","Talkative","Sleepy","Headache","Hungry","Paranoid","Relaxed","Happy","Giggly","Focused","Euphoric","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth","Energetic","Dizzy"],"ID":"229362"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"acdc","user":"XSEgo","stars":"0","date":"10/19/2014 5:26 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Relaxed","Sweet","Citrus","Lemon","Nutty"],"ID":"229363"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blackberry","user":"XSEgo","stars":"0","date":"10/19/2014 5:39 AM","attributes":["Topical "],"ID":"229364"},{"_type":"dict","content":"one of the best sativas i have come across. ..","strain":"jack-herer","user":"svitalec","stars":"5","date":"10/19/2014 6:32 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"229365"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"jack-herer","user":"mistercap420","stars":"4","date":"10/19/2014 7:04 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Energetic","Happy"],"ID":"229366"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"sunset-sherbert","user":"spacemanop","stars":"5","date":"10/19/2014 8:55 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"229367"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Good, clean-feeling high","strain":"headband","user":"jackkrone","stars":"4","date":"10/19/2014 1:51 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed"],"ID":"229368"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This strain is definitely one of my favs, kinda creeps up on you.

Took 4-6 hits from that joint and told him that was all I needed, being a lightweight. We were in his car driving around and making small talk afterwards, him driving and me in the passenger seat. I was laid back and very relaxed. I felt high, but not in a \"wow I'm high\" sense, just that I was very relaxed, slow moving, and content with everything going on.\n\nAfter about a half hour, I decided I wanted to go from the buzz/laid back high I was riding to actually high, seeing as I was with an old friend and he had almost an ounce of weed, I wasn't really being a burden by smoking more. I told him I'd rather hit it in my bubbler, so we drove to my house and grabbed it. He decided he'd hit the bubbler too, rather than smoke his own joint.\n\nI explained to him that I was a lightweight and that if I smoked too much I'd trip too hard and freak out (I am diagnosed with Panic Disorder so finding weed that agrees with my anxiety is super important to me), but he insisted it was fine and packed me a huge bowl. He was smoking me up after all, so I just took it. I tried my best to clear the bowl but I couldn't. After a huge hit that didn't even clear it, I handed it to him, telling him to clear it because that was enough for me and I was gonna be coughing for a few minutes anyway. He cleared it, packed his own bowl, smoked that, and then asked if we were done. I told him to pack me a very small bowl that would be my last one and, again, he packed a huge one. Same thing - tried my best, took a huge hit but couldn't clear it, and gave it to him to clear after a coughing fit. We then took back to cruising, listening to music, and catching up with each other.\n\nThis lasted about 15-20 minutes, during which we stopped at a gas station where I stumbled and laughed a lot while he filled up a tire of his that was low on air, went back to cruising and then the trip began. My tongue went numb, which for me is the trademark first sign of a bad trip. My legs, arms, and hands went numb shortly after, and a panic attack hit me pretty hard. Yelling at my friend to take me home, I took .5mg of clonazepam to stop the trip, and sipped on the drink I'd brought with me (non-alcoholic) while we made our way to my house. It took me about 30-45 minutes to come down to a point where he felt comfortable leaving me at home alone, which is a bit longer than most of my bad trips last, likely due to the size of the bowls he packed me.\n\nMost of my friends have told me that the trip I described here is their favourite kind of trip, and that they find it very hard to achieve. Well, I'll tell you that with Critical Mass, that trip's very easy to reach. Although I am a lightweight, I didn't smoke a whole lot (definitely no more than a gram), so someone with a regular tolerance wouldn't have much trouble reaching that point. If you like that kind of high, this is definitely some great weed for you. It's potent and gets the job done. However, if you've got anxiety like me, you may want to avoid it - unless you still like that type of high. I've kept my eye open since then to avoid smoking this strain at all costs, but the person in my city that is selling it is keeping it stocked because it's very popular. An awful strain for me, but a fantastic one for any smokers without any considerable anxiety.","strain":"critical-mass","user":"kastour","stars":"2","date":"10/24/2014 7:58 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Sleepy","Giggly","Happy","Paranoid","Anxious"],"ID":"232343"},{"_type":"dict","content":"very prime indeed ladies and gents","strain":"apollo-13","user":"BIGCHTR","stars":"5","date":"10/24/2014 6:53 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"232342"},{"_type":"dict","content":"The best puff I had in Amsterdam.\nHas a unique sweet nice taste and hits u well.\n(:","strain":"vanilla-kush","user":"Adi","stars":"5","date":"10/23/2014 6:39 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Relaxed","Euphoric","Uplifted","Tingly","Lavender","Rose","Honey","Mint","Vanilla","Butter","Tea"],"ID":"232362"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Full-auto bullets made of peace.","strain":"ak-47","user":"Pactolus","stars":"4.5","date":"10/23/2014 7:25 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Sweet","Pungent","Earthy","Skunk","Tropical"],"ID":"232363"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"purple-candy","user":"AmbassadorAwsum","stars":"0.5","date":"10/23/2014 6:46 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Sleepy","Dry Eyes"],"ID":"232394"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I find this strain pretty potent and I can either be really happy or really paranoid.","strain":"purple-kush","user":"quorious","stars":"3.5","date":"10/23/2014 7:09 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Giggly","Euphoric","Relaxed","Sleepy","Dry Eyes","Paranoid"],"ID":"232426"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Aaahhh, just what I was looking for.\nVery thick, sweet smoke!","strain":"sensi-star","user":"limey08","stars":"5","date":"10/23/2014 7:13 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Uplifted","Happy","Aroused","Creative","Relaxed"],"ID":"232458"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Clean smoke, not to rough on the throat.

I wasn't aware of how difficult it would be to get my hands on such a long-flowering strain. Fast forward about a decade... after a failed grow attempt I finally managed to get one mature organic, california-grown AU#1. It took almost 10 months to mature... This had better be good.\nI just rolled an Amsterdam tulip with AUH#1. Lit, toking... toking... taste.... nice Spicy, cheesy, minty, sweet-bell pepper-ish... no hint of anything fruity but a fennel-like sweetness in the aftertaste- this is perfect! not over pungent, not too strong, not harsh at all... literally the best balance to date I've ever tried. I could smoke this all day long, and love that sweet floral nose.\nI have experience. Other varieties I can compare this too are my organic Kali Mist, Arjan's Haze #3, Super Silver Haze but with greater sophistication and many subtle flavors and smells. Unlike these its very balanced with no one scent or flavor dominating the palate. Truly world-class connisseur cannabis.\nThe high... that surprised me. I felt a very mild sensation for about 10 minutes. So I smoked another. Then BAM! The biggest creeper ever! Im chilling sitting back on my chair and then I'm off into my thought world more clearly and more deeply then I have been in ages. This is serious stuff! But perfectly clear. \nI love to meditate, and for that many of the other verieties cloud my thinking.

The bud tender told me the looks were decieving though and the Ghost delivers!\n\nIn general its kind of trancey and stoney in a satisfying way.

I felt like i was a tribal shaman, no joke. Real good strain for \"tapping into natures frequencies\" if ur into that.\n\nIn general I'd say Ghost is a very creative, inspiring strain.

I vegged for 45 days, and bloomed for 90. At day 70 I harvested the primaries and lowered the lights. Harvest continued until day 90. Every calix produced small 'spider buds'.

I'm a lightweight, and have only been smoking small amounts (.1 - .3 grams) at a time to avoid over-smoking and causing me to trip too much because I've been doing that a bit too much recently, and also so I don't waste all my weed at once. I've smoked this weed about 5-8 times now, the first half of those times being hit out of a pipe or bubbler, and the past 4 times being from pinners rolled with just .1g.\n\nHit from a pipe or bubbler, I remember my highs being great. Relaxed, but not super tired, and very euphoric. Made it easier to enjoy a movie or game and also made lots of things funny (even though they often weren't very funny), lots of giggling, and impaired my typing and texting a little bit, which is a point at which I know that I'm high enough to stop smoking and enjoy myself, but that I could still probably smoke a bit more and get more fucked up. With this strain, I've never pushed it that far, because I've been smoking lightly as I mentioned. I'd hit this in my pipe or bubbler, go inside and play some League of Legends. Making stupid decisions like taking bad champs for the wrong roles and building stupidly is one of my favourite things to do high, and that's what I'd do after smoking this weed, every time. I found it fun to experiment and when I'd die and screw things up as a result of my dumb champ/role picks I'd find it hilarious. It would be hard to bring my mood down while I'm high on this weed.\n\nIf smoked in a very small joint, it gave me a strange sensation in my body. As I'd walk, I'd feel my loose pant legs touching each other and felt like it wasn't the fabric over my leg I was feeling, it was just my leg. Hard to explain. It made me feel like my body was very transparent - that's the best word I can think of the describe it. Even though it didn't clear my head (and probably did the opposite as weed usually does), my head felt transparent, clear, weightless as if my brain wasn't in there anymore. It was an interesting experience with all of the feelings I'd have in my body, but it didn't provoke my anxiety at all (most highs that make my body physically feel weird trigger massive panic attacks). I'd become much more talkative, although my mouth would go dry (after the first or second pinner I found myself refusing to smoke them without a drink on me). My mood wouldn't be very elevated, but I'd feel content with whatever I was doing. Because I was only taking a few hits of a .1g joint, these highs were very modest, and as you can see by how the high was when I'd smoke more in a pipe or bubbler, the amount (and perhaps method) you smoke really does make a huge difference. I'm not sure how you'd feel if you smoked a very large amount.","strain":"white-shark","user":"kastour","stars":"2.5","date":"10/25/2014 3:16 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Talkative","Relaxed","Giggly","Happy","Creative","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"233166"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"uk-cheese","user":"greensheep124","stars":"0.5","date":"10/25/2014 5:12 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"233167"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Was real good made me super chilled and sleepy ","strain":"ak-47","user":"jamesaj69","stars":"4","date":"10/25/2014 3:06 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Sleepy","Happy","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"233168"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I'm about a half gram deep on some and chillin very nicely.

Purple Bud Feminized is easy to cultivate indoors, even for beginners, and will flourish outdoors in the spring and summer of a temperate climate. \n\nPurple Bud feminized is bred from some of the most important cannabis gene-pools in the world. Her parents and ancestors can be traced directly to the legendary Indica cultivars of Afghanistan’s Hindu Kush region, to the California medicinal marijuana scene and, naturally, to Europe’s weed-breeding epicentre, the Netherlands\n\nTwo pure Afghanica cultivars are the main influence behind Purple Bud Feminized, and are the source of this hybrid’s high potency, swift flowering, dense buds and sturdy frame. The more distant Sativa ancestor is a sought-after Jamaican variety which gives Purple Bud a little extra height and a lot of extra high to complement her body-centred Indica stone. The final stage in the breeding of our all-female Purple Bud seed-strain was to cross this 75% Afghani with a stunning Kush hybrid made from Dutch-bred Hindu Kush and a US purple Kush.\n\nPurple Bud’s purple colours are most commonly seen in her flowers, not just in the leaves (as is often the case for cannabis strains where the purple tendency is weaker). While her leaves often change colour as well, it’s not uncommon to see Purple Bud Feminized finish with green leaves that serve to accentuate her deep purple buds. The strain does not require a cold snap to bring on her colour change and will often turn violet in normal temperatures.\n\nBuds of the mature plant are thick, solid and spiky with great expansion, covering a majority of stem and branches by harvest time. Her purple floral clusters are thickly frosted with sparkling resin glands and possess a rich pine-sandalwood aroma with sweet undertones.","strain":"ecc022a7-d497-4aae-80d2-4aeb24d8f0a7","user":"speedyloc","stars":"4","date":"10/25/2014 10:57 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Hungry","Relaxed","Happy","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth","Pungent","Sweet","Woody"],"ID":"233232"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I was hoping for a bit of giggly happiness but I just had a really relaxed tired feeling which is kinda boring to me, personally 2/5","strain":"grape-kush","user":"Ninjatrtlehead","stars":"2","date":"10/26/2014 1:13 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Dry Mouth","Dry Eyes","Sleepy","Paranoid"],"ID":"233233"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Gets me a bit creative minded while falling asleep (homemade edibles for insomnia), makes for an entertaining internal movie as I fall asleep","strain":"chemdawg","user":"DancerDJ","stars":"5","date":"10/26/2014 2:51 AM","attributes":["Edible ","Sleepy","Relaxed","Creative","Happy","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"233234"},{"_type":"dict","content":"a little goes a long way!

This can also be a wonderful sleep aid in slightly larger doses.","strain":"10b78b0d-0694-452d-86a8-23d45e2773ac","user":"xavier_32","stars":"4","date":"10/26/2014 6:14 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Relaxed","Sleepy","Happy","Pungent","Skunk","Pine","Sweet"],"ID":"233429"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"tangerine-dream","user":"AMAurora","stars":"0.5","date":"10/26/2014 11:10 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize"],"ID":"233430"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"green-crack","user":"Mac36","stars":"4","date":"10/26/2014 12:35 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Aroused","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Focused","Happy","Headache","Relaxed","Uplifted"],"ID":"233450"},{"_type":"dict","content":"this was myfirst Sativa diminant strain ive tried in a long time. it certainly gave me an energy boost and i was up and talkative and HUNGRY as well...

Smoked it in my friend's backyard sitting on some lawn chairs just talking about our week and such. I suffer from bad anxiety and even when I get a strain that is good for my anxiety, I often overthink things at the start of a high and stir up anxiety anyway. GWS never aggravated my anxiety, but I'd sometimes freak myself out when smoking it. This time I felt no anxiety at all.\n\nI smoked half of it (the person I was with quit weed) and put it out, and made some more small talk. We then turned on my camera and played different beats on his phone while he freestyled over them and made videos of it. I'd be beside him dancing and doing silly things like we were in a music video. After a little while, we went inside to get my friend his dinner as he hadn't ate yet. I felt relaxed and had that \"dumb\" high feeling that's hard to explain. However, the exchange I had with his mother will help anyone who's had that feeling understand right away: I said \"hi!\" to her, she said hello, and I just looked at her for a good 5-10 seconds and then walked away (normally I'd follow up with a how are you or something, but my mind went blank). I thought that was kinda funny afterward. My friend ate and we went back outside to make more videos.\n\nBeing about an hour after I smoked the first half of the joint, I smoked the rest of it. I was having a blast being pretty much a hype man for my friend's rap videos and doing a bit of dumb freestyling myself. I laughed at a lot of things and ended up eating an entire bag of chips. I was really enjoying the chips, I definitely had the munchies, but for a short while I felt a bit sick. Not like I was going to puke, just that I should stop eating. But I continued and finished the bag, and a bottle of Pepsi, without feeling more sick.
