In that respect, I would recommend this strain to try as it is an interesting high and can provide recreational value, but there are much more entertaining strains out there.

It's a $10/g strain, the 1/2 price is $100 or $110, I got this as a freebie through their rewards program so not really sure on price.\n\nIt didn't look particularly great and wasn't expensive, so I wasn't really expecting a lot, but it's actually fantastic.  Almost the perfect daytime strain, it's really mellow but with a nice sativa buzz and great energy.  \n\nAs I said the flowers aren't particularly impressive to look at.  The buds are small and not as tight as I would've thought, the color is mainly dark green with lots of reddish-orange hairs.\n\nVery different flavor profile too.  Didn't like the smell at all at first, it's very earthy and pungent, but in an unusual way.  The earthy quality is almost a leathery smell and it grows into very flowery lavender and tea notes.  The smell of the whole flowers is really intriguing.  Despite my initial dislike I found myself repeatedly going back to the jar, sticking my nose in and trying to figure out what it smelled like.  It really grows on you over the first couple of days.  \n\nThe ground flowers have a strong lemon / citrus scent with only a touch of the earthiness found in the whole flowers.  The smoke is very smooth with a woody / earthy flavor.","strain":"og-kush","user":"adk1978","stars":"5","date":"2/8/2015 7:07 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Happy","Uplifted","Energetic","Focused","Sweet","Lemon","Flowery","Citrus","Lavender","Earthy","Woody","Tea","Pear","Tree Fruit","Pungent"],"ID":"301000"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Helps me a lot with pain, doesn't make anxiety an PTSD any worse; it seems to help some.

After a couple bong hits it felt like all the blood rushed to my head and my eyes became a bit twitchy and my body tingly. \nMy friend became very tired and then we both knocked out, the next day we woke up our eyes were red, dry and very sensitive. \nIt's a nice smoke the taste isn't to bad either it's quite earthy, but i don't recommend this strain if you want relieve from pain or cramps. \nAfter smoking this strain more than once you start to receive body relaxations the only thing i found as negative is that the eyes become very red and dry.","strain":"amnesia","user":"Badbitch_reefs710","stars":"2.5","date":"2/8/2015 6:20 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Energetic","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Sleepy","Tingly","Uplifted","Creative","Focused","Relaxed","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth","Headache","Earthy","Pungent","Skunk","Spicy/Herbal"],"ID":"301114"},{"_type":"dict","content":"An excellent nighttime strain, just the ticket for insomnia, stress relief, and pain control.

The medicinal qualities of this tasty strain waft of hashish and a semi-sweet, mild, but very pleasant, herbaceous fragrance. The medicinal qualities paralyze the body with a narcotic, THC cloud pillow—losing the majority of nociception from my neck down through my toes—while forgetting that I even had a body! This strain's effect upon my consciousness was more akin to an LSD trip, in that upon closing my eyes (which I had no clue they were closed for the two day trip I experienced in an hour) fractal, three-dimensional shapes unfolding and superimposing upon each other. Meanwhile, real-life cinematic scenes projected \"in front\" of me, yet I could shape and create them at will; like a lucid dream. The euphoria and creativity the expanded from these percepts were followed by an expansiveness of being and perspicacity; proceeded by a short, transient state of arousal, eventually blurring back into the former. Though, obviously LSD is much stronger, however, from my seasoned experience, I have not come across a strain like this. I'm going to attempt to describe it as mix of oxytocin and a mild LSD trip. Beautiful and spacious. If you are lucky enough to find this, get it! no true negatives; only if you overindulge, you experience a relatively mild feeling of anxiousness and/or an infinitesimal degree of paranoia. NOTE: not for beginners or intermediates. \nPhysical effects: 9/10;\nMental/cerebral effects: 9.5/10 \n A shout out to\n#OM OF MEDICINE, Ann Arbor, MI, for their exceptional quality of medicine and their unprecedented quality of service—you feel more like a friend than a customer there; and the atmosphere and place is just so serene and comfortable; feel like I could chill there all day.

Not something id recommend to beginner or even intermediate smokers ( such as my self).","strain":"lemon-haze","user":"SG70sman","stars":"4","date":"2/10/2015 3:26 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Tingly","Uplifted","Giggly","Creative","Energetic","Paranoid","Headache","Anxious","Dizzy"],"ID":"302320"},{"_type":"dict","content":"0.56% CBG-A\n    < 0.01% CBG\n    0.56% CBG-TOTAL\n    24.71% ∆9-THC-A\n    0.32% ∆9-THC\n    < 0.01% ∆8-THC\n    < 0.01% CBN\n    25.03% THC-TOTAL\n    0.05% CBD-A\n    0.11% CBD\n    0.16% CBD-TOTAL\n    < 0.01% CBC\n    0.43% ACTIVATED-TOTAL\n     \n    ∆9THC + ∆8THC + CBN + CBD + CBG + CBC\n     \n    Cannabinoids that have been activated through decarboxylation (curing/storage of flowers, or heating/cooking of edibles, tinctures, & concentrates)\n\n                                                                                               \n\n\n    Analytical360.com\n\n\n    Analytical360.com\n\n \nTerpene\nProfile\n\n                                                   \n\n    < 0.01% Linalool\n    < 0.01% Caryophyllene oxide\n    0.17% Myrcene\n    < 0.01% beta-Pinene\n    < 0.01% Limonene\n    < 0.01% Terpinolene\n    0.07% alpha-Pinene\n    1.35% Humulene\n    0.24% Caryophyllene\n    1.83% TERPENE-TOTAL","strain":"la-confidential","user":"lydiaunicorn","stars":"0.5","date":"2/10/2015 4:21 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize"],"ID":"302321"},{"_type":"dict","content":"7.

Had a refresh(went to bed at 1:00AM, woke up at 10:00AM) and didn't think this was going to really do anything.\nWOW WAS I WRONG.\nI suffer from a hiatal hernia in my esophagus that causes heartburn, loss of appetite, and nausea. I wake up with these 3 symptoms every morning. After having smoked that bowl approximately 15 minutes ago, I no longer feel heartburn or nauseas and I'm about ready to eat a full bowl of cereal. I also suffer from back pain due to severely knotted muscles and a dislocated disk in my lower lumbar region of my spine. This strain takes care of most of the pain, but as you can imagine, when the high runs out, the pain comes out. But for the duration of the high, I'm not bothered by my back's natural pain. Only if I'm high and am doing heavy lifting does it still hurt at times. Migraines are something I've been experiencing recently for the past few months. I wake up with one each morning, smoke the size bowl described, and voila! It disappears once I notice it's gone. That's how well this strain does of taking care of migraines. For recreational use, I would recommend something with less of a sativa and more of an indica. Don't get me wrong, if you just wanna smoke with some buddys and get high, you'll get high and have a great time on this strain! But not the kind of high you want. I guess you could say its not a very \"social\" high because you'll find yourself much less talkative. At least I did lol.

Very green and frosty looking, and the nugs were decently sized.\n\nEffects: The first night i vaped an almost full bowl from my Arizer Solo at setting number 4. The immediate effects surprised me, because im more used to the creeping effects that my vaporizer produces. This strain made me feel energetic at first, very happy and talkative, and made my overall mood better. I did find out that I do enjoy this strain more when vaped on a higher  setting. It really mellowed out this stativa alot, and made it more enjoyable the second time around.\n\nNegatives: The only real negative was that i felt a little cold and seemed to have a little  discomfort. I experienced that during my first time using it. second go around, I cant think of nothing bad to say.

Very potent. \n\nFunny thing is that about 10 minutes after I vaped that hit I got a call from this phone number: (213) 438-9463, from California; apparently it was an Old Spice gimmick and, ya, I thought for sure some Aliens were coming to abduct me but I really didn't give a shit anyway. \n\nAin't no doubt her haus, that ther be sum fuuuked up sheet.","strain":"black-widow","user":"troylennerd","stars":"4","date":"2/12/2015 6:56 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Aroused","Creative","Relaxed","Sleepy","Tingly"],"ID":"305036"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Very potent and hits hard.

It was VERY relaxing and helped me sleep.\n\nI did experience slight paranoia and anxiety at the peak of the high but it quickly dissipated and turned into a very euphoric enjoyable high.\n\nThe only downside is it made my mouth VERY dry and I suffer from dry eyes in general so this made my eyes very itchy and dry, I picked up some eye drops to counter this tonight. \n\nI also recommend washing your hands after rolling this I think part of the reason my eyes were so itchy was because after rolling it all the crystal and plant material stuck to my fingers like crazy and I think I got some in my eyes. \n\nThis is a VERY potent and STRONG strain, having suffered many panic attacks from smoking pot I was very careful and only took a couple tokes and REALLY enjoyed the high, but my partner in crime tried to be a hero and smoked the rest of the join to her self, she spent the night on the floor in the washroom and is a fairly regular smoker who usually doesn't have any bad reactions.","strain":"hash-plant","user":"Dr.PurpleSocks","stars":"5","date":"2/12/2015 10:53 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Hungry","Relaxed","Sleepy","Tingly","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth","Flowery","Earthy","Pungent","Skunk","Woody"],"ID":"306059"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Me and my buddies smoke often and so far our favorite strain.

Will try not to eat too much of anything else in the next couple hours, and hopefully it will take effect more quickly. \n\n40 minutes later, I do seem to be getting just a bit dizzy.\n\nAfter 60 minutes, eyes and mouth are dry, though mouth not as bad as eyes, and they aren't bad relative to what I sometimes get. Slightly tingly. Nausea worse than usual. Dizziness remains quite mild. Wouldn't go so far as to say there's a relaxing effect, but I do feel looser in muscle groups other than my core. Hungry and sleepy, but not sure that either's the weed's fault. Won't take more for at least another hour, but thinking I'll likely want a larger dose.\n\nAfter 2 hours, all effects remain mild. Don't think there's been any pain relief, and I'm actually hurting more now than when I first took the stuff. However, I do feel vaguely high, so there was some kind of effect from eating the AVB straight. Suppose at some point I'll have to compare effects of a similar-sized dose when it has been infused into something fatty via heat, see if that actually makes for a stronger high. Today, I'm just going to have more of the straight burnt herb. Have been burning the heck out of my stuff when vape-ing, so probably not a whole lot of cannabinoids left when I'm done. So, having another 0.4g at 2:35.\n\nNot feeling any different at 4:00. Did have some food after 2nd dose, but I should really be feeling something more by now. Maybe the AVB straight doesn't actually work. I had sore eyes plenty before I started using weed, and I've always been thirsty. On the other hand, I did read that AVB may have fewer head effects, because so much THC was already removed.\n\nIt's 5:30. Still not certain whether I'm actually high.

I like the strain so much that I kept a male in a separate, isolated location and used its pollen to seed a few buds on my Mendo Purps, Romulan Queen, Covelo Sour Diesel, Bubblegum females, as well as with a Sweet Tooth girl. I'm excited to see how they do in this year's garden! The Sweet Tooth girls reached an awe-inspiring 11' -12' in height, with a beautiful hybrid structure. They were relatively easy to grow, requiring one good clean out of its lower branches before the stretch, simple bracing during flowering  to help support the weight of its huge colas (4-6, 10' tall bamboo stakes around each plant and green gardener's ribbon), and, as the buds ripen, some pruning of its nitrogen-deprived fan leaves, which give a beautiful display of red, purple and pinkish colors, reminiscent of a Vermont hillside in the fall! I expected harvest time to be around the 1st week of October, and to my great pleasure, they were ready to pick during the 1st and 2nd week of September. Each plant yielded around 700 grams of lovely golden-green buds with long, red hairs and were loaded with super sticky trichomes that, to me and many others that sampled my batch, smell exactly like Juicy Fruit gum! It tastes like it smells, and absolutely lives up to its name with its intensely sweet and smooth smoke. It's smoke produces a euphoric, soaring high that works well any time of the day or night! Lab testing revealed just over 21% THC and 1.3% CBD.This strain works great for stomach pain, cramping and nausea, as well as an appetite motivator. It may be my favorite strain from my garden last year, and I wouldn't mind having a garden full of these HUGE plants! A couple of puffs makes me feel inspired and creative and want to pick up a guitar immediately and strum it! Or, other times (Like right now!) a couple bong tokes will relax me as I read myself to sleep! ...G'night, y'all!

The smoke was a wee bit harsh and near the end of the bowl I started coughing more frequently. as soon as the bowl was finished I could no longer gauge time accurately and a sense of euphoria came over me. I knew at this point that I was going to be REALLY high for a pretty good amount of time. I laid down on my bed with my chest up and my arms spread out and euphoria just began to wash over me. my body was completely relaxed and my heart rate began to pick up. I've never had good eyesight but now my eyesight was crystal clear. colors seemed richer and the light from the sun shining through my window was just transcendent. since then I've had a lot of spiritual experiences after smoking this bud. this high really lifts my spirits and even long after the obvious effects of being high are no longer felt, the happiness, energy, and a sliver of euphoria are still there.

Smoke from a bong is very smooth, no irritation in the throat. Tastes earthy, nutty, and woodsy, with strawberry coming through on the exhale. Has a super functional CBD high, lightly energizing with increased focus, great for starting your day. I have serious chronic pain due to repeated motion injuries, and about 10 minutes after consuming this, the pain is almost gone completely. I also suffer from severe anxiety and panic attacks, and this puts me in a very calm state, acts as a bufffer against things that would normally send me into a spiral of negative anxious thoughts. Being so naturally tightly wound, I can't enjoy many high THC/sativa leaning strains, but if I smoke this as a precursor, the CBD mellows out their high THC content without detracting from their unique effects.

I am the Chronically Acclaimed Comic Reviewer! OHHHHH MANNNN! where do I begin with this strain? CHARLIE SHEEN AKA TIGER BLOOD, LETS START with the look. I can only describe it as a perfect looking bud, nice compact and dense, light in color with orange hairs nicely covered in beautiful trichomes. OKAY NOW lets get to the smell because even though they say you cant judge a bud on its smell, I appreciate a nice \"dank\" smelling bud. I opened the lid to the jar to immediately be assaulted by a diesel-ish potent gasoline smell. I assumed that it was a relative of the Green Crack strain but I thought for sure it was more Sour Diesel in family genus (very surprised it was an OG kush and Blue Dream strain). OKAY NOW THE GOOD PART, Tastes mmmmm mmmmm good! Tastes like it smells \"chemically\" like a Diesel strain or Green Crack BUT still leaving a bit of sweetness on the back of your throat (for like the first 5-7 hits before it gets all resiny tasting) after the initial chemically taste you get that woody taste they describe. FEELING WOW WOW WOW!!! I have to say the feeling kicks you hard and fast hitting the head VERY indica strong (like a green crack headbands kinda feeling) it makes sense that this is a Blue Dreams hybrid strain because the sativa feeling is very similar in that it feels like tiny little strings are attached to your body  being pulled up in the slightest way. I have to say CURRENTLY this is my favorite strain I normally don't get a strain more than once or twice because I like to keep trying new strains BUT I have come back to this strain 5-7 times because it is the most consistent high I have experienced. I like to use 'onies' when I review a strain because I like to smoke less and get the same high which I get EVERY TIME. This is a very energetic high that I would recommend for a day smoke or a \"wake n bake\" it doesn't have an exhausting come down like most strains and keeps you alert. Great for going on a hike or smoking right before going to the gym. I would say this is a great strain for Anxiety ADHD NOT for insomnia 10/10. \n\nFor more reviews just look for ChronicComic reviews here on Leafly OR go to my blog at chronicallyacclaimed.wordpress.com THANKS hope this has been educational and informative.\n\n-Chronically Acclaimed","strain":"charlie-sheen","user":"ChronicComic","stars":"5","date":"2/21/2015 3:56 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Happy","Relaxed","Uplifted","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth","Pungent","Woody","Chemical","Diesel"],"ID":"314443"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This is a pretty good Sativa strain with a nice enjoyable head high.

It was nice and lime green and about 6 inches tall. The Clone was well-rooted in rockwool with a nice cluster of healthy, snow white roots showing from the bottom of the rockwool cube.\nI took the clone home and transplanted it into a party cup full of Roots Organic potting soil. After a couple of days, I could see a change in color at the end of the growing tips and the clone began to get taller. \nOnce the clone was about 10 inches tall, I transplanted into a 5 gallon pot of Roots Organic potting soil. This is where the plant began to take off. Place under 12 hours of light under a high pressure sodium bulb, the plant really began to take off with particularly explosive lateral growth. The plant was becoming a bit taller, but also much bushier. I was feeding once a week with Dyna Gro Foliage Pro at a concentration of 1.0 EC and pHed to 6.8. \nI topped the main colas several times. Within three weeks, there was significant bud growth and the plant was looking extremely healthy. I decided to keep the nutrient concentration pretty low at 1.0 EC because it is best to start low and see how the plant responds. 1.0 EC seemed to be enough as the leaves remained green and healthy and the bid sites kept on a coming. \nWithin 5 weeks, I thought the plant smelled exactly like a delicious blueberry muffin with a hint of skunk in the mix. It is a wonderful smell! The buds continued to swell throughout the grow. There was also an awesome surprise: One night after the temps dipped into the 40s in the grow room, the buds became purple!\nI chopped the plant at 60 days. After a week of drying and two weeks of curing, the buds weighed in at 2.5 ozs.\nThis is a heavy indica smoke. It is fruity and delicious and the buzz lasts a good two hours if you can stay awake that long! This medicine melts pain and worry away, and will put you to sleep if that is what you are looking for. I would definitely recommend this strain for excellent smoke, good yield, and easy to grow.","strain":"blueberry","user":"neobes","stars":"4","date":"2/21/2015 6:56 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Euphoric","Giggly","Happy","Hungry","Relaxed","Dry Mouth","Sweet","Berry","Blueberry"],"ID":"314512"},{"_type":"dict","content":"really good strain some of the best i have ever had gets you on a high you can love not to gone yet not that weak just right\n","strain":"blue-dream","user":"slaredo100","stars":"4","date":"2/21/2015 8:01 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Uplifted","Flowery","Earthy"],"ID":"314513"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"silver-surfer","user":"mairnsy","stars":"4","date":"2/21/2015 11:43 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Giggly","Happy","Sleepy","Uplifted","Relaxed","Hungry"],"ID":"314538"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Super potent hybrid at 32% THC\nA very intense euphoric experience, it just kept lifting me higher and higher.

My heart beated through my wondering mind and out through my eyes. The dreamy cerebral high with body tingles is the best. This is definitely where I parked my car. My mind raced with productive ideas. \n\nFunny story,\nSo my girlfriend, like me, prefers sativas because we are both very active and crafty. However, she has to be careful when when trying new strains as she is especially susceptible to paranoia. One morning, I packed my one hitter (Which easily holds 4-5 hits) full of this killer queen strain. I pack a pipe for her every morning she works but thought this strain would be good for her to try. Of course I didn't tell her. So, after work sitting in traffic on her comute back out to the country, she decides to remedy her traffic blues with some music and a few tokes. The high sets in fast and she is instantly freaked out. She is so worried about her driving and people watching that she tosses my pipe out of her window.

This is the type of bud you used to get back in the day, and before you smoked it you were thinking the dealer stiffed you with these small popcorn buds. Some things never change.  I keep reading reviews with the same complaint.  Let me explain that this is how pre 98 bubba, and a lot of good kush strains, should look.  This is because the Hindu Kush mountains, where kush landrace strains originate, are so hostile the plants grow short stubby buds covered with resin to survive the cold. Anyway the effects of the strain are pure magic. Novice to veteran smokers are immediately hit with a giggly, euphoric feeling that spreads throughout.  The strain works wonders for insomnia, but used in small bursts can make for \"sweet, dope, fly\" 90's style magic anytime.  This was a staple indica back in the day and should be now for anyone.

It was violet if you were imaginative, but most importantly made the Juniper-like trees whatever they were in front of my apartment building glow purple to me.  I only pulled down about seven grams (one primo, one gram main cola per plant or so) of this strain but had the absolute once in a lifetime experience of smoking my last bowl of it \"with\" the late great Jack Herrer, huddled under a tent at Hempfest's 2005 Hemposium while medical marijuana activist Angel Raich and others discussed fighting and loosing the good fight.  I had the bowl packed in my backpack, and was considering exiting the tent to smoke at the next break, but when Jack pulled out his signature custom wood piece and took a needed medical toke, I decided to follow his lead and did the same. So happy I did.  It was a surreal experience.  Needless to say, I miss this strain tremendously, and didn't get to experience it for long enough.

Yup those goof ol boys are bringing home seeds from the crops they raided and coming home to serve up delicious crops from this heavy resin producing new group of cannabis the THE STRAINS IN THE AFGHANICA FAMILY ARE (in order and grouped by scent); All the kushes (minus OG that's in the gas family of Afghanica),now the gases are; OG kush Chem dog, Headband, and Sour Diesel, the next are the sugarey smelling but still very resinous afghan goo, and hash plant. Jorge Cervantes wrote the Grow Bible and explains Afghanicas. It is a real thin CANNABIS GROWS ON EVERY CONTINENT EVERYWHERE THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT WEED IT ADAPTS TO ITS ENVIRONMENT AND THE THINGS AROUND IT PLEASE SHARE THIS.

I have followed him since day one when he got the strains to creat this cup-winning strain. He always had mad growing/breeding skills. But after Incognigrowfarms took home the cup. The breeder @cookiemaine from The Captains connection, his ego shot through the roof knowong that his strain won a cannabis cup and all the haters jealous of the win. Even though the only thing he had to do with winning was breeding the strain (he didnt really have much faith in that strain either untill Incognigrow found the killer pheno. He didnt touch the plant once or the hash untill after it was entered. But he still claims that he won the cup, he does gives credit to incognigrowfarms when its brought up but he trys to make it sound like the cup is his because he breeded the strain. After the cup there was ALOT of people hating on their entry saying it was improperly dried. With his GIANT ego hes been calling people out for no reason talking shit to them to make himself look better. He started talking shit and ruining relationships between close people to make himself look better and/or to get more followers by creating drama and making the other person look bad. He started hating on @weewu because he tried making S1 seed of blissful wizard but he didnt ask for permision from @cookiemain to give them out even so he started talking shit about him and  even thou a couple weeks before the cup they seemed like great friends and were even planning on running a booth together at the cup. Another incident was when the man who sold @cookiemain the clones that he used to created the BSW. He commented on a picture saying he loved how his genetic were used on a cup winner. @cookiemaine immediatly started calling him a hater because he didnt create those strains he just grew them and sold the cuts. But seriously who gets pissed at their source for their cup winner just because what he said was taken out of context. @cookiemain is a hot-headed drunk who has been burnt out for the past 10 years who just got lucky enough that a plant he threw pollen on was grown so well and made into amazing hash by someone thats not him actually won a cannabis cup. Hel talk shit about anyone who says he has a big ego or go against him saying his product is shit. His product is good but when your a total fucking dick no one cares. On instagram, it was pointed out to him how many followers he gained after he dissed one hash company and he seemed like he was just tryjng to start shit for no reason just to get people to Follow.This guy does not deserve any fame or respect for winning the cup hes a major piece of shit who will throw people under the bus to advance his own agenda.

Indica strong. Still has a nice body tingle which would help you relax if you are like me and have restless leg syndrome that prevents you from relaxing long enough to slip to sleep. \n\nDetailed review\nSmell: I'd say this smells very chemically with a sweet flowery smell like you would find with 'green crack' \n\nLook: Very light dense buds with short orange/red hairs occasionally popping up. Coated incredibly nice with trichromes, it could only be described as looking really kiefy. \n\nTaste: Like the smell, it has an initial chemical taste with an earthy wood after taste. \n\nFeeling: It was a slow start that crept up on my eyes. It hit me in the forehead first and moved around to my entire head in probably a span of 5 minutes. Next your extremities start to tingle, like that feeling after you just shocked yourself. It has a slight energy to it that could make it useful if you were to be doing something (like writing an interview as I am now) but i would definitely use this to go to sleep. I would NOT use as a \"wake and bake\" or afternoon smoke, I would say this is the \"wait till after work and you just had a crappy day and need to relax on the couch and put on your favorite episode of Firefly\" kinda strain that really helps you relax when your on edge. Good strain for ADHD, Insomnia, muscle pain and anxiety. Probably not a good strain for depression, exercising or operating any kind of machinery that isn't an xbox controller. All in all this is an amazing strain 9/10 that I would want to have around for those crappy days and sleepless nights.\n\nI purchased this strain from High Country Healing off of Academy in Colorado Springs.

I can vaguely feel how this could turn into some kind of manic episode if I ever managed to take too much at once.\n\nSuper dizzy, pretty fidgety, even my fingers as I try to type. Hard to keep my eyes still, even. Man, the ticking from that creepy devil-child is starting to get to me. Earlier, I was instead once again enjoying that I could literally see rainbows while I was high. \n\nTyping is getting even harder. Can't /quite/ track all of my fingers without looking at them from time to time.\n\nI guess there's pain relief? I also can't quite remember what it was like before vaping, even though I was paying attention to it. As with some other strains, I feel like either there's an extra tightness in my gut, or I'm suddenly super sensitized to that area.\n\nNow my spelling's suffering is starting to grow. Alas! What sorrows these. Hmm, perhaps I shall write a poem. It will be all the more interesting if I try to remember not to use the backspace key for typos, only edits to word/structure choices after the first draft is finished. On the other hand, that sounds really hard, just now. Mindless stretches would be easier, if more painful.\n\nAnyway, midway through first session, started getting this nasty, sweet syrup with the vapour. I blame my jury-rigged filter system, since this happened the last time I vaped D.OG, too. Also, because my second sesh was abruptly halted, and future sessions with this bowl cancelled, when my system failed and I breathed in a ton of particulate. The ones I was able to keep in my mouth, as opposed to my lungs, tasted so truly, incredibly nasty, that I had to gulp down water with such immediacy that I didn't even breathe out before drinking. Naturally, this led to me swallowing all the vapour in my mouth at the time, so I had shit coming up both tubes for awhile there. I don't know how smokers can stand that kind of shit going into their lungs.\n\nFresh bowl, did my best to have both filters firmly in place, but I still got stuff in my mouth. Added mouth-piece cover with a third filter, directly over the cap, then the whip on top of that with its filter. That didn't work, so I switched the plastic pieces. This made it harder to draw from the vaporizer, because I somehow seemed to be getting a lot of the surrounding air, instead. Also, I still felt stuff getting in my mouth. Can't help wondering if I'm imagining it - does a person necessarily know if they're being paranoid or hallucinating?  I was getting auditory hallucinations again, earlier; it sounded like really quiet country music, as best as I could make out. Maybe it's not from the weed, but the plastic that was discoloured by the rubbing alcohol when I was trying to clean things this afternoon.","strain":"jack-herer","user":"Aladrieth","stars":"3","date":"2/26/2015 11:05 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Vaporize","Creative","Energetic","Happy","Hungry","Sleepy","Tingly","Anxious","Dizzy","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth","Headache"],"ID":"320235"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blueberry","user":"yungqueso","stars":"4","date":"2/26/2015 11:36 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"320236"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This is a fantastic, sunshine-uplifting kind of bud.

My sample is rock hard 1-5g mini pine trees with orange hair and patches of light/dark green similar - gets that wonderful 'crispy' texture when cured long enough.  \n\nThe smell is very representative of both parent strains - the fuely-skunk of the Sour Diesel is definitely there, and alongside it you have the spicy kush licorice 'funk' that only the OG can provide. \n\nThe taste is complex, earthy, skunky, and slightly tart ... from inhale to exhale a very pure consistent taste - quite nice if you like green hits and that powerful fresh herb flavor.\n\nThe high is very medicinal and full bodied - meaning you get both an immediate strong head high and the gentle melting of the body.  The OG really seems to balance out the speedy Sour Diesel - just a really pleasant total stone that should be a benchmark of a top notch balanced hybrid.  I find it to be a 65/35 sativa type high - good 'competition' for strains like Blue Dream, Lemon Kush, or OG itself.","strain":"sour-kush","user":"BJW","stars":"5","date":"2/27/2015 2:44 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Happy","Relaxed","Uplifted","Citrus","Earthy","Pungent","Skunk","Diesel","Spicy/Herbal"],"ID":"320491"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Nice relaxing buzz, super calming.

I like it clean but I wanted brand spanking new clean to smoke this! I held out almost an hour and finished Cleaning the pipe, It's never looked better! I loaded my big bowl onto the pipe and had put water on the freezer but I don't freeze it. Filled the resivoior to it's fill line and loaded and took a massive hit, it was so chilled by the water I didn't realize how much I had! Big coughing fit ensues, but couple drinks of water I'm ready to go for #2, after my head stopped spinning, eyes bugging out and I regained speach, \"Hand me that! Bitches!\" Or something just as stupid was said? I got a much more manageable hit and was able to taste it! Sage, lavender, Vanilla, Lemon rind, strong, smooth blueberry taste with a creamy finish on the inhale, lots of fruits, citrus and such a wonderful aroma! Very therapeutic to the senses, though I didn't really have anything to say about it a sound? lol. \n This was a great strain! I'm a heavy user, I medicate from before I wake up. Very high tolerance. And I smoked 2 bowls packed a 3rd but never got to it till just before bed.\nMedical for me: Lot of joint, muscle & bone pain, light sensitive, migraines from \"repetitive blast syndrome\", I've PTSD, sleepdisorders, loosing my left foot soon? Idk the date yet? So I live with intense amounts of pain. Opiates are all Dr's want me to take.

The body high is intense making my muscles twitch occasionally, lightly, but not noticeably and my hands and feet tingle. It's pretty strong, but not the strongest. The buds looked pretty good even though I got a batch that wasn't quite dried correctly. It had a nice white coating of kief throughout and was very dark purple and green. If it was dried better it would probably produce a lot of kief for the bottom of my grinder. It tastes clearly of grape, with a sweet grape aftertaste that lingers for a while. Out of the bowl, this weed was harsh as fuck, hurting my throat immensely as I inhaled, but out of the gb it was pretty easy to hit and hold.

Breathing was shallow unless I focused on deep breathing. I started to wonder if there was a chemical contamination or something. The effect didn't totally wear off until the next evening. Interesting colors and textures when I'd close my eyes. A lesser dose (10 drops) the previous day only yielded a head buzz and sleepiness.

I usually smoke at night because I have problems sleeping. This strain is definitely one that you need to smoke at night.. Unless you have an extremely high tolerance, or can hold your composure very well, stay your ass at home. My body was completely numb, assuming the occasional extreme focusing on certain parts of the body, the only way I can describe it is somewhat of a 'floating' feeling. I was very couch locked and barely made it up a set of stairs without laying back down. It takes away the pain after about 20 minutes or so, but it does have a slightly uplifting high that hits pretty much immediately. Tips for this strain: stay inside, smoke before bed, don't smoke too much (extreme paranoia is a high possibility), have eye drops ready, and get a few bags of doritos, a bag of pizza rolls, and a case of your favorite soft drink because munchies and cotton mouth are two huge negatives.  Sometimes some strains start to wear off after a week or so of using them, but this one doesn't. Bright orange hairs, and light green buds with hints of purple, lavender is a beautiful strain. While the herb lavender is usually a more smooth smell, the lavender strain hits really hard in the throat and lungs, so using a bong with ice is recommended. By the way, it smells and tastes just like lavender with obviously pungent weed aromas mixed in.","strain":"lavender","user":"Romptoast","stars":"5","date":"3/5/2015 4:30 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Focused","Giggly","Happy","Relaxed","Sleepy","Tingly","Dizzy","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth","Sweet","Lavender"],"ID":"325740"},{"_type":"dict","content":"dude.....\n\nokay okay so usually i smoke mids and i haven't smoked loud in a while so i went out on my roof and i started hitting my bowl and i was like...\"this is taking so long!!!\" so i waited and i waited. then, finally, it hit me. like a shit ton of bricks. i tried to crawl back into my room through my window and it was just insane and it was raining. this only happened like ten minutes ago, it's still kind of hitting me. then i sat on my bed and started watching American Dad with my brother. everything was so vivid and so beautiful.i just wanted to write and draw. gosh. overall this has been an amazing experience and i would not recommend this to a newbie. just made me so happy and creative and relaxed, and very nice. good strain. good time. a very mellow high, not so neurotic is the others. very very VERY potent. wooooo. sorry if this is long and redundant but i just wanted to share them with another person.","strain":"green-crack","user":"muackqoo","stars":"5","date":"3/5/2015 4:55 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Giggly","Happy","Relaxed","Talkative","Uplifted","Earthy"],"ID":"325741"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I picked up 2 1/2 ounces of this a while back.

Also super sparkly - very well frosted. Think it's the stickiest I've encountered yet; it's a bit crazy, and makes grinding more difficult than usual. Didn't dump out the bag, just peered inside, but looks like lots of medium-sized buds (ie: ~0.5g), my favourite.\n\nNever had a spicy weed before, though some previous bags have touted 'piquant.' Anyway, I like it. Also taste the diesel, but haven't really detected grape, yet.\n\nAll three usual side-effects. Bit floaty. Extra nausea, but may not be the pot. Relaxed.

The smoke was very smooth, a mix of sativa smoothness and the somewhat rough harsh indica. Its was on the smoother side, which i prefer. Great flavor with the vape pen around 380f.

It doesn't help much with my PTSD nightmares, but I wake up at whatever I set my alarm to and don't have any hangover effect. Downside: You're asleep in 5-10 minutes which is great for people like me but there's another problem: You can only focus on exactly one thing at a time (literally. Except basic bodily functions but sometimes you feel like you have to remember to breathe and have to focus on just that only). If I'm typing something, I'll forget to listen to the audiobook I was listening to or the food I have in the microwave etc. Vice versa for any of those. \n\nAlso, I tend to \"procrastinate\" turning off the light (every time I use it) by getting up and getting things, and rearranging my bed, or doing something that does not involve going to sleep. But once I  actually turn out the lights (and stop fiddling with my cell and, when I had one, yammering to my boyfriend and lose track of what you were talking about every 5 seconds. Did I mention you also ramble? *cough* ), you conk out in 5 mins. You never even get a sleepy feeling like meds (though if you use too much you get very dizzy), it's just the minute you lie down  you're falling asleep without realizing it. It's like a sedative that could fell a horse (forget ketamine....).\n\nAnother complaint: I (unlike most mj or mmj people), I really really HATE the taste and smell of mj. This stuff smells strongly, tastes strongly, and burns the back of the throat if held in for too long or used on a higher heat settings than 4.3v (3.3 is perfect though temp-wise) and if you use it in one place too long it starts to get that \"pot den\" smell. If you wash whatever you sit/lie near when you vape it, it's no big deal (at least this has me washing my sheets weekly...).\n\nOh and last but not least - this DOES sometimes cause a headache if I put off going to sleep for to long.","strain":"purple-kush","user":"ssquared","stars":"4","date":"3/9/2015 10:12 AM","attributes":["Concentrate ","Relaxed","Sleepy","Talkative","Tingly","Dizzy","Dry Mouth","Headache","Earthy","Pungent","Tar","Menthol","Minty"],"ID":"327887"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This is fire, super focused heady high, taste and smell is off the charts.

The strain is well named - it carries strong qualities of the notorious Chem Dawg with a noticeable taste and scent with a diesel or laboratory quality, a potent cerebral high, and a steady body feeling. \nTapping into the Alien Technology side, the cerebral high was sharp and focused and felt almost \"out of body\". This would be a great strain for the day-trippers or those who are seeking a mind-high night journey. At times I felt paranoid, as if an \"alien\" or foreign entity was monitoring me - so there is some aspect with either taking too little or too much that may hit on paranoia, fear, or nervousness in the mind, even though as an indica it provides a lot of physical rest. \nI think it would be good for aiding in healing the knees or the throat.

First, this strain obviously sativa dominant, is full of creative focus and uplifting effects. Sage also is not a face melter or produce couch lock in anyway.

Very well cured buds with beautiful kiefy leaves. Sweet tasting, kind of like pine and orange mixed incredibly well. The high is definitely in the head but very energetic and focussed, great for a wake and bake or and even smoke. Good strain for relaxing or going on a hike, this is one of those unique highs that can adapt to whatever the situation. This strain would be perfect for Insomnia, Anxiety, Depression, Pain Relief and Relaxation.\n\nDetailed Review:\nSmell: Sweet citrusy smelling with a nice flowery after note.\nSlightly diesely but definitely a strain that just keeps you wanting to smell it forever. \n\nLook: Fluffy but dense, a strew of different sizes skinny and long and short and fat but always a nice cone shape. The trichromes that coat this bud are dark and full but shine bright under light. Long orange hairs that surround the dark green buds, making this a very beautiful strain aesthetically.\n\nTaste: Earthy and sweet but always full of flavor long throughout the bowl. The first toke is an earthy flowery taste on the inhale and a citrusy orange flavor on the exhale. The flavors stay prominent long throughout the bowl  but slightly change to that of smoking a diesel strain towards the end. This bud is definitely a delicious strain to have around. \n\nFeeling: A hybrid of Purple Thai and Afghani this strain is a fast hitting high that hits you in the body and head at about the same time. I'd say this hybrid is about 50/50 but has a more energetic sativa rush to it that stays with you long after the head high is gone, letting you stay focused on whatever task you need to accomplish. This is an incredible \"chameleon\" type of high that is perfect for adapting to whatever task is at hand. If you just want to relax on the couch and play video games or if you want to go on a hike or climb a mountain, this strain would be perfect for anything!","strain":"flo","user":"ChronicComic","stars":"4","date":"3/10/2015 6:29 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Euphoric","Focused","Happy","Uplifted"],"ID":"329069"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Really uplifting.

A mere thirty minutes into smoking, I begin to feel the floor of a fall that I can only describe as the mental equivalent of sinking to the bottom of the ocean. I feel very heavy, as if I'm a bouncy ball that some other worldly thing threw into the dark void of space. It's lovely. Interestingly enough, if you put a small amount of thought into moving your limbs, you can easily conquer the couch lock. The downsides to the experience begin with an unrelenting case of dry mouth, followed by becoming easily distracted and incapable of behaving reasonably in public. I find myself focusing onto noises and music without being able to identify the source of the sounds, which gives everything you hear and listen to a \"theme music\" aspect. Visually, it's difficult to focus onto anything for longer than two seconds, unless that \"thing\" happens to be a bright light, such as traffic signals and street lamps. Being outside is ideal, largely due to a heightened feeling of connection to the earth (if you enjoy outdoor meditation, this is a great strain to take with you). An hour in and I'm beginning to level out, And that dramatic beginning about falling into space is starting to weaken; I can't decide whether or not I'm glad, or if I'm going to smoke more so I can return to the surface of the moon. Food has a very detailed quality when consumed, and I keep experiencing closed eyed hallucinations when chewing, seeing the general shape of the food being eaten as if it's inside my mouth. Mmhmm. Beverages, on the other hand, taste desaturated, which makes eating more about the actual eating (I would highly recommend this strain to those of you who enjoy sushi or sashimi). The time is now 7:04pm, and I'm beginning to come down, so I'll conclude my review with this: If you want to broaden your understanding of the senses, then breath God's Gift in deep.

It's lovely. Interestingly enough, if you put a small amount of thought into moving your limbs, you can easily conquer the couch lock. a downsides to the experience begin with an unrelenting case of dry mouth, followed by becoming incapable of behaving reasonably in public, and being quite easily distracted. I find myself focusing onto noises and music without being able to identify the source of the sounds, which gives everything you hear and listen to a \"theme music\" aspect. Visually, it's difficult to focus onto anything for longer than 2 seconds, unless that \"thing\" happens to be a bright light, such as traffic signals and street lamps. Being outside is ideal, largely due to a heightened feeling of connection to the earth (if you enjoy outdoor meditation, this is a great strain to take with you). An hour in and I'm begin to level out, so that dramatic beginning about falling into space is starting to weaken, and and can't decide whether or not I'm glad, or if I'm going to smoke more so I can return to the surface of the moon. Food has a very detailed quality when consumed, and I keep experiencing closed eyed hallucinations when chewing, seeing the general shape of the food being eaten as if it's inside my mouth. Mmhmm. Beverages, on the other hand, taste desaturated, which makes eating more about the actual eating (I would highly recommend this strain to those of you who enjoy sushi or sashimi). The time is now 7:04pm, and I'm beginning to come down, so I'll conclude my review with this: If you want to broaden your understanding of the senses, then breath deep. you're home.","strain":"gods-gift","user":"Delsin","stars":"3","date":"3/11/2015 2:12 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"329278"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"maui-wowie","user":"manolomon","stars":"4","date":"3/11/2015 3:06 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"329279"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Jack's Cleaner, a strain I would love to get my hands on again.

I first tried Lavender in early  November after hearing good things. It was awful. So dry and unpleasant it was like smoking bad potpourri. This cut is from Grow ops farms in Washington State. The bud easily is one of the best looking buds so far in the rec market. A Bob Ross-esque cacophony of purples,pink, orange,and of course  green.  The bud was cured perfectly and after snapping a piece off in your hand, a out of this world smell, similar to a pack of chewey spree candies, comes out. The taste is truly unique. Almost fruity pebbles mixed with Lavender. More grape flavors at times than the GDP, or Grape ape I've tried. The high itself lives up to the aroma and taste. After 10 minutes or so instant calm comes over your body. The sedating almost narcotic type body high should be treated with caution by infrequent smokers or nap time may commence quicker than expected. The high also provides enough of a sativa buzz for experienced tokers to make this damn near a perfect bud. At the present it is hard to find. For me,like I stated earlier, this is a great reminder to not give up on a strain if you have a bad first experience be by bad grow or whatever. Bottom line....5 stars all the way.

A mere thirty minutes into smoking, I begin to feel the floor of a fall that I can only describe as the mental equivalent of sinking to the bottom of the ocean. I feel very heavy, as if I'm a bouncy ball that some other worldly thing threw into the dark void of space. It's lovely. Interestingly enough, if you put a small amount of thought into moving your limbs, you can easily conquer the couch lock. The downsides to the experience begin with an unrelenting case of dry mouth, followed by becoming easily distracted and incapable of behaving reasonably in public. I find myself focusing onto noises and music without being able to identify the source of the sounds, which gives everything you hear and listen to a \"theme music\" aspect. Visually, it's difficult to focus onto anything for longer than two seconds, unless that \"thing\" happens to be a bright light, such as traffic signals and street lamps. Being outside is ideal, largely due to a heightened feeling of connection to the earth (if you enjoy outdoor meditation, this is a great strain to take with you). An hour in and I'm beginning to level out, And that dramatic beginning about falling into space is starting to weaken; I can't decide whether or not I'm glad, or if I'm going to smoke more so I can return to the surface of the moon. Food has a very detailed quality when consumed, and I keep experiencing closed eyed hallucinations when chewing, seeing the general shape of the food being eaten as if it's inside my mouth. Mmhmm. Beverages, on the other hand, taste desaturated, which makes eating more about the actual eating (I would highly recommend this strain to those of you who enjoy sushi or sashimi). The time is now 7:04pm, and I'm beginning to come down, so I'll conclude my review with this: If you want to broaden your understanding of the senses, then breath God's Gift in deep. you're home.","strain":"gods-gift","user":"Delsin","stars":"4","date":"3/12/2015 2:35 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Relaxed","Sleepy","Talkative","Dry Mouth","Sweet","Berry","Grape","Lemon","Earthy"],"ID":"330252"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Be careful, this strain grows on you.

When getting some food and drinks I was thinking we may need to smoke another bowl. But then it hit me, and that was some hit. A astonishing mental high with much laughing while watching tv. I was completely out of my mind and at that point it was by far the best high I've ever had. A couple of weeks later we had a second chance at smoking this strain. I rolled the nicest joint I've ever rolled with some extra kief and damn that payed off. The effect kicked in a lot faster this time and I was in another world. Best high and best high I've ever had.

Light green with long curly orange hairs is typical with a general spear shape to the flowers.  The smell (to me) is deeper fruit than pineapple, more mango or kiwi-banana but noticeably tropical.  The taste is a little sharper line pineapple but not pungent or heavy at all.\n\nTrainwreck by itself tends to be a real instant head-hunter; while all the famous Hawaiian flowers tend to be those long lasting creeper 'happy' sativas.  I assume the cross was meant to put some brakes on the Trainwreck (limit anxiety/paranoia) and extend the length and mood of the high with the Hawaiian.  I'd say this was acheived nicely - it's like a fuzzier/kinder/slower Trainwreck with less crash and more 'uplift' than dizzy-ringing-banging sativa high provided by stuff like Sour Diesel (which I admittedly enjoy quite a bit).  I definitely feel more productive/lucid with PX than SD or Trainwreck - though perhaps not as highly medicated; the tradeoff is the long lasting high that makes you want to get up and get moving on something.

On top of the great taste of this amazing strain, I really like that it had vivid purple striations throughout the nugget, very pretty. And not only was the taste great, this was some very smooth bud. I didn't cough one time while I was smoking which was nice because it's a little easier to relax and enjoy the medication if your throat isn't super irritated. All in all this is an amazing strain.
