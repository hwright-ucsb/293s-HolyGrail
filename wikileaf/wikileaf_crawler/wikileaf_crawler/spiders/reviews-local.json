Upon securing a variety of seeds, he returned home to America, and began honing in on inbreeding the lines which possessed his favored growing characteristics.\" This is the correct version,\" In 1978 Ed Rosenthal did indeed bring back Durban Poison seeds, but from Amsterdam, not from South Africa.. He gave them to me and I developed Durban Poison. Ed never grew this strain. The seeds were not from a developed cultivar (there was no seed industry then) It was a landrace of very mixed characteristics from mediocre to quite good potency and with a very early harvest time when growing outdoors. After several generations I had two distinct higher potency phenotype lines, the A and B lines. I did give the B line to Skunkman Sam and he further developed it in Amsterdam. The B line had about 10% intersex phenos, and I mistakenly gave the B to Sam causing him to have to rework the strain to eliminate the tendency to put out a few male flowers on about 10% of the females. the rest of the review is pretty good."], "stars": 4.5}, {"content": ["This strain is just better than the rest.
