This explosion of berry flavors is a combination of the bold and resinous BluePower, mixed with the super purple and dense hybrid known as LVPK, Las Vegas Purple Kush. Although this Indica heavy variety only produces average sized yields, what she lacks in production, she makes up for by providing an exotic bluish-purple color, extremely insane resin profile and a very distinct flavor and aroma that dances happily on your taste buds. Flowering indoors in around 9-10 weeks allows cultivators the chance to produce multiple harvest of super fruity and THC encrusted flowers in a single calendar year. The short, bushy and strong structure of the \"PowerPurps\" makes this a great choice for outdoor growers, but try and give her a bit of extra time to vegetate and she will still be done before the end of October, but will yield a lot better. The BluePower brings the exotic blueberry and earthy Kush flavor and aroma, while the LVPK provides the grape-candy profile that makes this amazing variety such a tasty treat. This \"cannaisseurs\" favorite is not only a beautiful present for your eyes, nose and taste buds, but she\\'s also another great medicinal variety that has an extremely powerful high. Starting off with a slightly uplifting and euphoric head buzz that quickly molds into a hard hitting body high that leaves your body warm and relaxed, while all your worries are soothed away by her calming effects."},
