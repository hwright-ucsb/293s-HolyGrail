The hybrid offers a great balance of both the energetic mind effects and a sedated body stone. The lineage of the strain is an original OG Phenotype, a cross between a Sativa father and Indica mother.\u00a0The name given to this strain as a dig on Hollywood marijuana dispensaries that were charging $100 an 1/8th ounce at the time. It's origins are in Northern California, the San Fernando Valley. THC content hovers right around 22%. This strain tends to grow large, dank green buds with scarce stems. These buds are dense, with a light frosting of amber crystals and spindly red hairs. The aroma is sweet and sage, with a hint of mint and earthiness for that extra kick. The potent effects of $100 OG Kush are better utilized at night, as feelings of sedation and relaxation will prove better for relaxation than it will for busy days. It is also advised to carefully measure dosage, as beginner smokers might feel overwhelmed by the powerful stone. Many even refer to $100 OG Kush as one hitter quitter. $100 OG Kush has powerful, long lasting effects with a variety of medical applications. Users can treat medical conditions such as anxiety and insomnia, the relaxing euphoria easing their mind and either alleviating their anxiety or helping lull them into a relaxed sleep. Those suffering chronic pain can also find relief when using $100 OG Kush. The strain is also used to treat muscle spasms and tremors. For those who need a boost in appetite, $100 OG Kush is a great choice as it tends to stimulate the appetite effectively, and may also be used to alleviate Gastrointestinal Disorder. Others may use it to treat symptoms of Bipolar Disorder, Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). $100 OG Kush is primarily grown indoors, and grows solid, dense buds, both medium and big in size.

It is a popular strain around Bay Area clubs, with rumors indicating Ed Rosenthal has had a hand in it's creation. It features an earthy, hashy taste that is not too strong or overpowering. The juicy, crisp scent proves to be a formidably pleasant aroma. Some users note creativity, although it's most notable effect is a heavy sedation and deep relaxation, which of course makes A-10 a useful strain in combating a variety of medical conditions and ailments. The effects of the A-10 strain provide users with a sedated body-type stone. The high levels of CBD and THC levels of around 18% make A-10 a ideal choice in a variety of medical applications. A-10 can be used in the treatment of anxiety, relaxing the user and effectively lowering stress levels. A-10 can also be used to fight chronic pain, and can prove useful in dulling the symptoms associated with migraine headaches. This strain can also be used to alleviate symptoms of Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS). A-10 can also prove useful to those battling insomnia, providing a deep relaxation and narcotic effect that will lull the users into a deep, satisfactory sleep. Those suffering from nerve or muscle spasms can also find relief in A-10, as the effects of the strain are heavy and indulgent. Due to the heavy body stone associated with A-10, it is best to indulge in the evening or on a lazy day of relaxation. It is not a wise choice for a wake and bake on busy days full of responsibilities and obligations, as couch lock is almost a guarantee. This is a great strain for a Netflix binge or song writing session locked away alone in a music studio, but a poor strain for a family reunion or double shift of work. Do not operate heavy machinery or vehicles under the influence of this strain, as the effects are both potent and long lasting.

It has dense green buds with a taste of menthol and a hint of citrus. Its high is typical of a classic stoner high - euphoric and giggly. A-Train also hits hard leaving you feeling famished but not too lazy to go for the food in your refrigerator. The couch-lock effect of this strain can be nearly overwhelming and cause some users to feel sleepy. It is a feel-good high that leaves one feeling happy even after the high fades. Some users report an increase in libido while using this strain. The downsides to A-Train are all fairly common - dry eyes and mouth with occasional bouts of paranoia and anxiety for some users. Because one of the strain's first most pronounced effects is the munchies, A-Train is often used by people suffering from anorexia and nausea. Others use it for insomnia, opting to let the sleepy buzz overtake them for a restful night. People dealing with chronic minor aches and pains can benefit from the strain, but those with severe pain will likely pass on it. Due to the happy high, it is also used to help regulate anxiety and mood disorders such as depression. The strain is most often used for evening and night-time medicating. A-Train is half-Sativa and half-Indica. It is a mix of Arcata Trainwreck and Mazar-i-Sharif Afghan. The strain was started in Holland, and although it was bred with the intention of growing indoors, some have successfully grown A-Train outdoors. For indoor cultivation, one has to consider the choice between hydroponics and soil. Plants grown in hydro will have higher yields, but those grown in soil reportedly taste much better. In hydro, the plants can produce yields between 300 and 400 grams per square meter. In soil, they produce between 200 and 300 grams per square meter. A-Train plants grow wide and 120-140 centimeters tall. For this reason, they are best raised as multiple branching plants. The strain requires anywhere between 53 to 60 days to flower. For growing this strain with hydroponics, TH Seeds recommends using Botanicare Pure Blend Pro and Liquid Karma to help ensure plants get their necessary enzymes.

The second one, the word headband, is a direct reference to the effects this strain can have.

Still, that did not keep DNA Genetics breeders from taking a crack at figuring out 707 Headband's lineage. After a few rounds of tasting the fuel flavor of the strain and its effects, DNA Genetics came to the conclusion that the strain was probably a cross between\u00a0OG Kush\u00a0and\u00a0Sour Diesel. Most places specifically list it as a cross between a female OG Kush and Sour Diesel hybrid that was crossed with a male Sour Diesel. However, those claiming it came from The Breeders Lab, list it as a cross between\u00a0NYC Diesel, OG Kush and\u00a0Master Kush. Often stated as needing anywhere between nine and eleven weeks to flower, this strain can have a THC count of up to 24%. DNA Genetics have since released a strain based on the genetics they claim 707 Headband has. Many patients say it has almost the exact same taste and effect as 707 Headband has.

Suitable for most users to use all throughout the day, 60 Day Wonder may provide some patients will relief from chronic aches and pains. Others may find it calms their anxiety or depression and relieves stress. This strain may also be used to treat glaucoma and nausea. One large complaint about strains based off of ruderalis is the low yield, this strain may produce as little as 10 grams per plant or as much as 40 grams per plant. Still many beginners like them as they can germinate them quickly, plant them and leave them under 24 hours of light.

The buds are tight but fluffy and the color is green with orange hairs. Look for different delivery methods such as capsules, teas, tinctures, and lotions. Recreational users should pass this one by as its profile is more like hemp. Medical patients, especially those with severe disorders like epilepsy, should definitely try it. Medical conditions that ACDC may alleviate include cancer, alcoholism, seizures, and severe pain. Patients with less severe conditions also use this strain. An early study at New York University\u2019s Langone Comprehensive Epilepsy Center studied a preparation of CBD in an agent called Epidiolex. Investigators found that the drug was safe, well-tolerated, and effective. Due to the balance in Sativa/Indica, which may edge towards a Sativa, users should feel an uplifting effect including euphoria, peace, and happiness. You may feel more focused and more sociable. Some have described the sensation as completely relaxing without a worry on the horizon. Growers can expect a bushy plant with thin, feathery leaves that may grow as high as four feet. It looks and grows like a skunk variety with big colas. The leaves may turn a bit purple and the nugs are about the size of a thumb. Flowering happens in 9 to 10 weeks, longer in colder environments.
