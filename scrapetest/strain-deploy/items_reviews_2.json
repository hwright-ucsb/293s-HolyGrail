Again, those who know kush know that sight and even smell alone dont always tell the story.\r\n\r\nAnd oohhh what a story Herojuana told me.  I cant remember it for shit, but damn it was good!  An uplifitng high, moreso than any other indica Ive had, lasting well over an hour after two humble hits.  The only thing that could match the intensity of the high was the flavor of the smoke.  Almost candy-like...similar to a real good Sweet OG, but again x10.  \r\n\r\nIf you trust your dispensary, and they offer this strain, dont be a dummy! Get rescued by the Hero!\r\n\r\n10/10","strain":"herojuana","user":"JackDanieL","stars":"5","date":"8/4/2010 2:44 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Giggly","Tingly"],"ID":"207"},{"_type":"dict","content":"OG Kush is one of my personal favs alBig Daddy Kush and Alaskan Thunder Fuck.","strain":"og-kush","user":"skateryt5","stars":"4.5","date":"8/4/2010 6:42 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Uplifted","Giggly"],"ID":"208"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-dream","user":"Anonymous","stars":"5","date":"8/4/2010 7:32 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative"],"ID":"209"},{"_type":"dict","content":"New user, so don't expect the ratings to be that great (lack of reference points).

My personal sample is sticky icky and bright green with large healthy nugs. It has the occasional streak of purp, but in no way does the lack of wacky colors hurt my opinion of this fine strain.  I have read that it tastes like cotton candy upon exhale, and that the smoke around you can carry heavy hints of the same.

And it DOES bring that very sweet sweet 5star kush flavor, but even more than that, it IS a cotton candy-ish blend.  The rush is immediate, with a perfect pressure to the backs of the eyes, a general body relaxation, and of course, as you would expect from this strain, some ridiculous cotton mouth that will choke you out like a midget dressed as a hobo holding one of those little tiny umbrellas and....ok one metaphor too far?

I am a daily smoker and one of the most important qualities for a strain to have is potency over time and quantity. I gain a high tolerance to the majority of strains I smoke after about a quarter ounce, so any strain I can smoke an ounce of and it still gets me baked really stands out. I have smoked lvpk now for the last 6 months or so, and it still gets me baked as a cake. \r\n\r\nSmell- This strain smells like Afghan Hash, Floral Purfume, and a slight skunkyness.\r\n\r\nTaste- Taste Floral, Fruity, and Hashy\r\n\r\nLook- It has dense nugs that turn lavender on the tops and tips. The nug sturcture is indica but crowns out. The Frost can cover all the way out to the medium fan leaves. It gets just as frosty Tom Hill's as Deep Chunk. The bud grows golfball to baseball size tops. the BEST part though is the nugs from the bottom of the plant are dense as the ones on the tops which is also very rare.\r\n\r\nHigh- The high is very strong, and it is a hybrid feeling high. At first this strain is so strong that most people wont move for about 2 hours, but not because of couch lock. The strain can actually get overwhelming in visual and body effects for even experienced smokers. Once I got a little used to it, I started to move around more. I always end up listening to about 2 hours of music everytime I smoke it. The best way to describe the feeling of this strain is \"Euphoric Visual Comfort\" It makes me feel like the universe is perfect.\r\n\r\nSummary.

I have a pretty high tolerance, so this was pretty surprising.\n\nI was at Barnes and Noble after smoking this, and I ended up buying two Cannabis magazines and three  books. One was a social science/human behavioral work, another was related to history, and the last was about learning how to read literature critically. \n\nSoaring sativa high followed by a warm body buzz. \n\nThis clinic has some good bud.

This strain is truly top of the line, and there's a reason that it's one of the most popular medical strains in California. \r\n\r\nThe flavor of the buds is unmatched - I agree with the other reviewer who said it tastes like wintergreen upon inhalation. When you exhale, it tastes a bit fruity/lemony, and you get a distinctly skunky taste. The smell of the smoke is fantastic and classic.\r\n\r\nI do not recommend this bud for anxiety or sleep, as it has a lot of euphoric, head buzz qualities to it, unlike some other indicas that may be better for such medical applications. After I smoked my first hit of it, I had a grin plastered across my face. I think this strain has good pain relief qualities, but I have smoked other strains before bed to calm down because this bud makes me high, happy, and jubilant.

This strain is pretty strong and the effects kick in pretty quick, it gives you that total body relaxation (not mind high, more of a psyhical high). Perfect for those getting off work late and looking to mellow out after a stessful day at the office. Great strain for beginning/ intermediate smokers suffering from Anxiety, Stress and or Depression, also has a low pain relieving element I wasn't expecting. It really helped with my lower back and mouth pain I've been dealing with. The reason why I had to give it a 7 is because its still pretty expensive ($18-$22 a Gr.) for a high that lasts on average of 2-3 hrs per bowl. Also the effects are well balanced but for an experienced smoker like myself its not as strong as say Jack Herer or Hindu Kush. I'd go as far to even say White Window could be considered stronger then Bubba. Still since it does kick in immediatly its worth the good rating, just got to know when and where to buy. Great for a group of friends looking to get faded chill for a while and sober up quick.  \r\n\r\nOn a seperate issue, look for the lesser expensive Bubba Kush, frankly couldn't tell a difference between Bubba Kush and Bubba OG Kush( You'll Save $3-5 pr. G). Saying OG just jacks up the price. Both are same potency at least at my dispensary ones just grown indoors(Bubba) and the other outside(OG).","strain":"bubba-og","user":"cubano7649","stars":"3.5","date":"12/24/2010 8:32 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Sleepy"],"ID":"2880"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Great Flavor, can always remember the taste. The oz. I picked up had long thick (BAD TASTING) stems and densly packed nugs, stems were crazy thick so if your buying make sure your paying fair price (don't want to get stuck with grams of thick stems). Great smelling and great tasting bud all around. Strong strain gives that 1/2 energetic, 1/2relaxed high perfect for watching a movie with friends keeps everyone talking and laughing but still ground and chilled. Definetly great color bud amazing all over Orange hairs that don't flake or break off. Also a very moist bud (down side it will dry up as it sits) so better for bowl and bongs, not great rolled or Vaporized.\r\nOverall great strain on top of my list. Always a contendor when friends come over and we're gonna just kick it, however make sure you look at the stem and only buy what your gonna smoke within 1 - 1&1/2 weeks since its best when still moist.  Fair price would be around $16-18 a Gr. however since this is a relativly new strain its possible to score it for $10-13 a Gr straight from a grower.

Research in FOR-REAL, PEER-REVIEWED medical journals suggests that CBD is an effective anti-inflammatory and analgesic, and may help with Alzheimer's as well as the onset of blindness in diabetics. But, you know, that's all experimental. \r\n\r\nFor me, personally.. I honestly don't really even get \"high\" with this stuff, which I assume is due to the low THC content. It feels like Valium but without the edge/side effects or harsh come-down. The only buzz is in the body, and that buzz is significantly lighter than in most indicas (it feels more like an indica despite being sativa-dominant). I've felt sedation and a small amount of couchlock. Now, to the real stuff: it is by far the most effective painkiller of any strain I have tried, and I love that about it. I'm not a huge fan of strains that give you a weird mix of effects -- I like when strains are really good at one particular thing, whether that's getting me up, putting me to sleep, making a bad movie better, or in this case, taking the pain away after a long day. \r\n\r\nOne more thing -- because it's CBD-heavy, I would imagine most people trying it are probably after its potent medical benefits, and a large subset of those people may use vaporizers. Every cannabinoid has a different vaporizing temperature. CBD needs more heat -- specifically 206.3 (404.3F) degrees in order to vaporize. So make sure your vaporizer is properly adjusted and can reach that temperature -- otherwise, you'll need to smoke it.","strain":"43bb67e5-c40a-456a-baa3-86f571d5108f","user":"courbet","stars":"5","date":"12/26/2010 4:53 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Tingly","Sleepy"],"ID":"2918"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This shit makes me feel like I have no eyes or teeth, someone help me.","strain":"cheese","user":"Dick henderson","stars":"5","date":"12/26/2010 6:29 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy"],"ID":"2919"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"king-kush","user":"Davidmsaunders88","stars":"5","date":"12/26/2010 7:02 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Uplifted","Hungry","Sleepy"],"ID":"2920"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Very strong, indredibly long-lasting indica.

Had a bad reaction last night after having smoked it several times before. The only difference i can think of is that I had caffeine earlier in the day, and later in the night, which i never do. I can only think that having taken a large hit right before laying down to bed had something to do with this strange reaction. My muscles were tight, especially in my neck. My legs and upper body experienced large spasms, my mind was racing, and I had to meditate for an hour just to get the thoughts out of my head. I was insanely thirsty, and the back of my head ached. I had almost 7 glass of water, and instantly I had cotton mouth. I was freezing, I had 5 blankets on and was still not warm. I had to consult with my hubby to help calm me down. I felt euphoric, and at moments, in control, but would easily loose this control second by second. I was able to see outside myself and from others perspectives. Anything that i felt was an emotion, was from someone else's perspective. I personally had to confront over 50 situations in my mind that I had to answer to and resolve or they would loop endlessly in my head. I often had to get up and get more water, or focus on something else. I watch a movie which helped for longer periods of time, but the anxiety of the experience was difficult to put into check. I had thoughts that I was loosing control, and moments of paranoia where I felt I might have had a heart attack or a brain hemorrhage.  It only subsided 4 or 5 hours later, when I was finally warm, and my thoughts were sorted. I am tempted to explain this reaction to my dispensary, in case there is something with the strain itself. Perhaps it's not a pure form of the plant and there is another strain mixed in? Perhaps went I inhaled from the pipe, the bitter and thickness of the smoke was an indication? I seriously knew something was different with this. I'm not the only one who has had a similar reaction, just two weeks ago almost the same physical reaction was experienced by a friend with the same strain and batch where we got it.

PK has a high THC content (15-28%) and is a cross between Purple Afghani and Hindu Kush. The most recent strain I got was very high quality and upon smoking a tiny amount (to sample for the first time) I almost felt a happy, uplifting, euphoric type high (on a small scale) similar to a sativa.\r\n\r\n Don't get me wrong though this is strong Indica, it can be sedating, lead to couchlock and the munchies. I found my limbs would feel very tingly along with the back on my neck and it felt at times like my whole body was getting a massage, so this good to pain and muscle aches. \r\n\r\nOverall it's great medicine, very chilled, I would recommend using it later in the evening as if you have to do something, you won't want to leave you place if you get too baked. The high tends to be a happy high with sativa-esc (trippy) overtones. Being primarily an indica you don't get a strong energetic feeling from it, but certainly has uplifting characteristics.\r\n\r\nThis one is a creeper too. Taking a hit you might have to wait 30 seconds to a few minutes to feel the full effects.\r\n\r\nOverall well worth it, certainly a top 10 strain.\r\n\r\n","strain":"purple-kush","user":"Anonymous","stars":"4.5","date":"1/5/2011 1:13 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Uplifted","Happy","Tingly","Sleepy"],"ID":"3162"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"lamb-s-bread","user":"Anonymous","stars":"3.5","date":"1/5/2011 2:26 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Uplifted","Energetic","Happy"],"ID":"3163"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"alaskan-thunder-fuck","user":"Anonymous","stars":"0","date":"1/5/2011 2:45 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"3164"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"northern-lights--5","user":"Anonymous","stars":"0","date":"1/5/2011 4:10 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Giggly"],"ID":"3165"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"venom-og","user":"venom","stars":"0","date":"1/5/2011 4:38 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Sleepy"],"ID":"3166"},{"_type":"dict","content":"bread or breath? no mind-\r\nthis strain's truth lies on Marley's\r\ngrinning dorm poster","strain":"lamb-s-bread","user":"Cheher","stars":"4","date":"1/5/2011 7:44 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative"],"ID":"3167"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Heavy indica","strain":"lavender","user":"kollektiv.","stars":"4","date":"1/5/2011 7:53 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Sleepy"],"ID":"3168"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"afghan-kush","user":"rich38","stars":"4","date":"1/5/2011 3:48 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative"],"ID":"3169"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"og-kush","user":"sujeidy","stars":"3","date":"1/5/2011 8:16 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy","Sleepy"],"ID":"3171"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Just acquired this beauty.

It's a rather sweet, floral smelling bud.  With a vaporizer (325F), the taste is mild - nearly non-existent.  The buds are quite small - finger tip sized or smaller - but packs a BIG punch!\n\n\n\n   Previous to trying this strain for the first time, my wife and I had a deep & emotional, personal problems discussion - Major downer.  We were also quite tired and it was 11pm.  We wanted a little up beat on the evening...\n\n\n\n   It hit her almost immediately and hit me faster than most others.  We went from bummed to happy and energetic in no time.  ALL of our previous issues were completely forgotten.  We had never watched Glory Days before...It was great! So were the commercials.  After that we were hooked on Cheaters until 2am.  I have never seen my wife laugh so hard for so long - she was 100% pure happiness.\n\n\n\n   [PROS:] Highly uplifting, energetic, euphoric, and fun.  A clear headed high.  Great for watching funny movies, TV or just commercials.  Would also be good for small groups, party games, video games and/or sex (I'm talking about sex for two, but if the whole group wants in...Well, it should be good for that, too).  Munchie cravings are low, too.  Oh, be prepared to get talkative...\n\n\n\n   [CONS:] This is NOT a stone out, zone out, watch Baraka kinda herb. Don't use it if you want to get some sleep or down an x-large pizza by yourself.  And, be prepared to listen to everyone being chatty...\n\n\n\n   [SUMMERY:]  This is what I call \"getting high\".  You'll still have lots of functionality and comprehension while you enjoy the fact that absolutely nothing in this world is bad, sad or ugly.  You'll be energized, awake and aware.  Expect lots of fun and laughter.  This is one to be shared with others.  Don't be surprised if Blue Dream has become your new favorite, too...","strain":"blue-dream","user":"edfritz","stars":"4.5","date":"1/9/2011 12:11 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Uplifted","Energetic","Happy","Talkative"],"ID":"3244"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"lemon-sativa","user":"Zebulon","stars":"4","date":"1/9/2011 1:40 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Energetic","Focused"],"ID":"3245"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"fd62cf5c-0b7f-4116-8a8b-ccc80da5a6dc","user":"Zebulon","stars":"3.5","date":"1/9/2011 1:42 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Happy","Tingly"],"ID":"3246"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"island-sweet-skunk","user":"Zebulon","stars":"4","date":"1/9/2011 1:43 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Uplifted","Happy"],"ID":"3247"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"black-domina","user":"Zebulon","stars":"4","date":"1/9/2011 1:45 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Uplifted","Happy","Tingly"],"ID":"3248"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"durban-poison","user":"Zebulon","stars":"5","date":"1/9/2011 1:46 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Uplifted","Energetic","Focused"],"ID":"3249"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I may have just found my soul mate.

Under optimum conditions Blueberry actually has hues of blue and smells like blueberry muffins.  I searched high and low around Amsterdam for a good sample and finally found one at the noon coffee shop.  Good sweet taste and smell with an incredible high that is like an instant anti-depressant.  Colors and light seem very enhanced.  The buds are dense and round and covered with trichomes.  An up cerebral high if harvested during peak THC stage, but can be very very narcotic if harvested during the late amber trichome stage of development.  A great stain for those who need an all around smoke.

Very much sativa in it's growth habits but displaying a wider leaf morphology.  A hard one to grow for beginners, but it pays off in yield and potency after 8-10 weeks of flowering.  The effect of Sour D is purely medicinal in many forms.  It has an excellent anti-depression effect as well as a narcotic pain relief.  All without the lazy effects of some of the more powerful narcotic indicas.  The D will take you higher almost instantly upon the exhale and can sometimes be too much for those not familiar with it's head rush high.

I am not a patient, I don't need to smoke, but I'm 18 and have been a heavy cannabis smoker for 4 years. I have acquired a very high tolerance for smoking, which has lead me to want to quit smoking, to kill my tolerance. \r\n\r\nUp until recently, I haven't had access to medicinal strains, I usually smoke the generic Reggie, \"K\" bud, and from time to time generic Kush. Mostly K (Mid- grades)\r\n\r\nHeard I could get some Purple Urkle for 20 a gram.\r\nSnapped at the opportunity, of course. I Smoked 4 bong bowls with my buddy. Noticed a change in feelings after 1 rip. It helped me evaluate my mind's thoughts and automatically ordered my priorities for me. I began to see things from one overall perspective. I found it a calming high, one of those \"confident\" highs. Felt good to smoke it, didn't feel bad for me in any way, nor did it make my head hurt. I wanted to smoke this strain for my last smoke session until April 20th. It's just that it's that type of bud where, You don't want to quit after you smoke this! It feels, smells, tastes, looks, and sounds absolutely divine. Doesn't it? You will munch out, and fall asleep easily. Great for insomnia, and loss of appetite. For me, I just enjoy it. It is an indica strain, mostly a body high, but it still made me think, and I don't consider it any less-sativa, just more-indica. \r\n\r\nNow I can get grandaddy purps, and it's supposed to be better.

I give the Apollos a perfect 10 and give Cheese a 7.5 to 8.0 which actually is a great score since I a bit of a snob.  The high hits you pretty much within minutes of inhaling.  It doesn't take much to make u feel a little spacey.  The downside is that u are a little foggy and a little sleepy.

Like sinking into a nice pillow.\r\n\r\nI didn't have a strong feeling one way or the other for the smoke. (Although my vape broke and I had to use my little water pipe -- so I tasted a LOT more smoke than I usually do. I will review again when my beloved vape is back in action.)\r\n\r\nBut the high is very nice combination body/head high. A calmly centered high. The creative buzzing is there, but turned to low simmer so it's not always poking at you. The body is relaxed, but not couch-locked. You can do necessary stuff; but the high is not what I'd describe as \"energizing.\" (I actually found it a pretty helpful space for writing.)\r\n\r\nThis one really feels like a 60/40 Indica dominant hybrid. But I understand it's full Indica. Mild but pure.  (Damn, I just reread those last two sentences -- I'm really starting to sound like a pothead).\r\n\r\nIt occurs to me this would be a good choice for a family dinner. You want to be high, but you don't want your grandparents to know you're high. On this, you feel nicely chilled -- but you're neither a zombie idiot with zero energy nor a super-charged, but unfocused thinking machine. \r\n\r\nI think you could be pretty much \"just right\" at the dinner table with P. Kush, i.e., a smiling, charming, occasionally witty dinner companion. Just what the grandparents (and parents!) want to see -- and you want to give. \r\n\r\nIts charm is that it is very relaxing, but its real gift can only be appreciated if you allow it in and don't fight it. Turn yourself over to the Kush (Platinum version, no less) and let him hold you down -- and then you must choose to let go. At that moment -- at the precise point where your need to push against is equaled by your acceptance of being pushed -- you realize right then -- that you are just where you ought to be.\r\n\r\nP. Kush pushes you toward Nirvana -- but in the end it's up to you -- whether you touch it or not.\r\n\r\nGradually blasting off now...","strain":"platinum-kush","user":"nw_wa","stars":"4","date":"2/19/2011 8:16 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Happy","Hungry"],"ID":"4301"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"jack-herer","user":"Astor","stars":"0","date":"2/19/2011 8:27 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Uplifted","Giggly"],"ID":"4302"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"chiesel","user":"Anonymous","stars":"5","date":"2/19/2011 3:42 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Energetic"],"ID":"4303"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"f90dfca0-bf7c-4ce0-a5c2-32180c7ae039","user":"Bdav","stars":"4","date":"2/19/2011 4:19 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Focused","Hungry"],"ID":"4304"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Unique taste of cream cheese and/or nuts.

It smells just how it tastes. This bud has average smoke expansion and hits within a few minutes. This Sativa-dominant strain is great for daytime as well as nighttime use.\r\n\r\nChimera gives us yet another amazing strain. Frostbite comes in buds that are so caked with stick tri-chromes it actually appears white. Sprouting up from this snow-covered base are thick, orange pistils that looks like trees jutting up out of a snowy forest in January. They smell of fruit, dank, hash and skunk. This is a favorite strain among patients with all types of medical issues and is fairly common at many dispensaries.\r\n\r\nIdeally, this plant thrives in an indoor environment, although she does mediocre when cultivated outdoors. She tends to be a single-cola plant, although if she is provided adequate space, branching out can occur. A great strain for the Sea of Green technique, growers can expect to harvest between 2 and 3 pounds. Much to the delight of those who cultivate here, Frostbite tends to have such a large single cola during maturity that a stake is needed to prevent this beauty from collapsing under her own weight.\r\n\r\nGreat for aiding in a wide array of ailments suffered by patients, Frostbite is not only a potent, but a long-lasting Sativa-dominant hybrid. Patients typically experience a mellow, relaxing, yet upbeat mixture of a cerebral high and a pleasant body high. This can usually be found for between $50 and $55 per eighth at most clubs.","strain":"frostbite","user":"Schottenfeld","stars":"0","date":"2/20/2011 7:38 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"4351"},{"_type":"dict","content":"SJCBC","strain":"lavender","user":"Schottenfeld","stars":"0","date":"2/20/2011 7:43 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric"],"ID":"4352"},{"_type":"dict","content":"A bit overrated","strain":"lamb-s-bread","user":"Schottenfeld","stars":"0","date":"2/20/2011 7:45 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Sleepy"],"ID":"4353"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"master-kush","user":"Schottenfeld","stars":"0","date":"2/20/2011 7:46 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"4354"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-dream","user":"treebong","stars":"4.5","date":"2/20/2011 8:35 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Uplifted","Energetic","Happy"],"ID":"4355"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"ak-47","user":"treebong","stars":"3.5","date":"2/20/2011 8:44 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Uplifted","Happy"],"ID":"4356"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"ak-47","user":"treebong","stars":"3.5","date":"2/20/2011 8:44 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Uplifted","Happy"],"ID":"4357"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"afghan-kush","user":"treebong","stars":"4.5","date":"2/20/2011 8:47 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Sleepy"],"ID":"4358"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"northern-lights","user":"treebong","stars":"4.5","date":"2/20/2011 8:51 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric"],"ID":"4359"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"durban-poison","user":"DeeJayP","stars":"4.5","date":"2/20/2011 11:17 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Talkative","Hungry"],"ID":"4360"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I liked Grape Ape a lot , it actually did not hit me so much as a Sativa but more as an Indica at first .

Makes you smile and want to get out and do something. Smoking when fully ripe or a good 50/50 cloudy/amber allows you to experience the full potential of this amazing indica. You will experience confusion (not a bad kind), time warp/shift, kinda trippy environment when listening to music of any type. Shows and movies seem far more interesting but may seem a bit extreme, especially bad movies. Imagine going to the kitchen to get a glass of ice water and wondering why it seems like it took you 30 minutes to finish your task. \n\n\n\nI've added a sweetener to mine and so the flavor is incredibly sweet like I bit into a ripe fruit. Build up some resin and smoke some schwag and it will reward you with that sweetness to the crappy bud.\n\n\n\nThis bud improves with time so the patient are rewarded with some of the finest smoke. It should sparkly under light and very hard to break up with your fingers, i imagine a grinder would just make a sticky mess.

Overall, very fun-semi-productive strain. Two thumbs up!\r\n\r\nI also want to note that the above review was on the third time that I've smoked Green Crack (right now). The first and second time I smoked this weed, in low quantities, it made me really buzzy like I described above, but I was extremely energetic and ready for lots of action and adventure--maybe an awesome hiking weed? I think so.\r\n\r\nWARNING this strain will make you crave:\r\nCookie Crisp\r\nMilk\r\nOrange Juice\r\n\r\nBE PREPARED!

I found that I couldn't finish my normal bowl, and had to set my piece down. The high hit me all at once and relaxing wasn't my first choice. I almost wanted to go for a walk, but it was too late so I played some music and really enjoyed it.

Smell-wise it is nowhere near as pungent as some of the indoor OG Kush I've had.\r\n\r\nIf I'm honest it doesn't have much \"bag appeal\" at all, but the \"taste\" and \"effects\" departments are where this bud REALLY shines. \r\n\r\nThis specimen when smoked, has a robust, flavorful and smooth smoke. It finishes very clean with almost no aftertaste. It's quite honestly one of the best tasting Kush's I've sampled to date.\r\n\r\nWhat this particular OG Kush lacks in \"bag appeal\" it makes up for big time in the effects department. First, it is an extremely uplifting high that could be compared to that of a Sativa, but without any paranoia or racing thoughts. The effects are always predictable, a happy enjoyable high that is long lasting without being too \"couchy\" or demotivating. It does finish with a pretty heavy burn out so I can't fully recommend it for a daytime smoke. \r\n\r\n","strain":"og-kush","user":"tripdog","stars":"5","date":"3/17/2011 5:43 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Uplifted","Happy","Giggly","Sleepy"],"ID":"5278"},{"_type":"dict","content":"excellent pain reliever for severe chronic pain.

High doses can result in (not necessarily unpleasant) serious couch lock/nausea in users with low tolerance. At the other end of the spectrum, Sour Diesel can produce the most incredibly euphoric highs. No other strain I've tried serves as a better anxiolytic, and to me Sour D is THE benzo equivalent bud.

As an aside, Blue Dream provides a more mellow, longer high (think of it as being \"stretched\"), and NYC Diesel seems to be more mellow and have less of a cerebral rush in comparison.","strain":"sour-diesel","user":"meep","stars":"5","date":"3/27/2011 12:51 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Uplifted","Focused","Tingly"],"ID":"5539"},{"_type":"dict","content":"this is a hybrid of blackberry kush x haze. i smoked it out of my 2ft glass on glass triple perculated diffused downstem Biohazard bong and my Chameleon Typhoon Scientific Glass Sherlock Bubbler. really great high. starts out as haze head high that makes you creative and is good for depression. it then develops into a black berry kush body stone that just really mellows you out and takes away your aches, pains, and anxiety.

Opened the bag, piney, earthy smell. Not too overbearing, but very strong and fresh. I wasn't expecting much but it hit me from the top of my head and I was stoned. 15 minutes in, I started to feel very euphoric and elated. I was paying for food and a smile creeped across face and didn't leave for quite some time. I didn't have devastating couchlock, but sitting down felt very good and walking around was a nightmare. Time slowed down to a creeping pace and made me feel as if I was wading through thick water. Everything felt very hazy and surreal. I tried to do some homework and I was successful, but my motivation quickly dissipated and I was beginning to space out in a very unproductive way. I just felt like riding out the rest of my high in my bed listening to music. I woke up today 8 hours later and I still feel hazy and delighted but in a good way. Very good afterglow. Very potent medicine would recommend for a nighttime smoke. I don't see this being a day time strain as it saps all motivation and leaves you hanging out to dry. It does increase creativity.

HPRC is known for growing indoor, all-organic cannabis, utilizing over 30 years of growing experience from the head grower.\r\n\r\nFor 20$ a half 1/8th this Green Crack really delivers. Amazing visual aspects in this bud. Light green leaves which are almost completely covered in white crystal, accented with a fair distribution of orange hair. The smell is my selling point with this strain. Before your nose even reaches the jar, your greeted with a wave of sweet/sour musk which is also very present in the taste when smoked. \r\n\r\nThis bud (if flushed correctly) has an extremely smooth smoke despite it's sweet/sour aroma. The taste is very similar to the smell, with no lingering smokey aftertaste. The high is very cerebral, clouding and distracting thought. Tingling sensation is also present throughout body. Drowsiness was minimal (but was smoked during the afternoon). Laziness a little, but the drive to be active was most present. \r\n\r\nOverall, this bud always is very attractive among a line up.

The bud used in this review was purchased at HPRC. A local dispensary serving local humboldt residents with an indoor all-organic alternative medicine. \r\n\r\nThis bud stanks!!! The smell is a huge highlight for this bud. The very dense aroma of a mango/lime/lemonade blend meets you as you prepare to first smell it. The buds are beautifully sprinkled with a generous distribution of orange hairs and snow white tricomes. People have reported that this is their favourite tasting medicine out there, and I agree that it is top notch. The smell translates to the taste of herbs/mango/lemonade. The intake is smooth, but does have a bit of push-back, assumedly, as a result of the very pungent smells. One of the best and, i suppose, rarest buds I have come across.","strain":"vortex","user":"Inc","stars":"4.5","date":"4/8/2011 5:31 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Uplifted","Happy","Tingly","Dizzy","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"5991"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"afghani","user":"DeadGameSmokn","stars":"0","date":"4/8/2011 6:19 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Giggly","Hungry","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"5992"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"ak-48","user":"DeadGameSmokn","stars":"0","date":"4/8/2011 6:21 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Uplifted","Energetic","Happy"],"ID":"5993"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"bubba-kush","user":"DeadGameSmokn","stars":"0","date":"4/8/2011 6:25 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Uplifted","Energetic","Focused","Hungry"],"ID":"5994"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"cat-piss","user":"DeadGameSmokn","stars":"0","date":"4/8/2011 6:26 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Hungry"],"ID":"5995"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"chemdawg","user":"DeadGameSmokn","stars":"0","date":"4/8/2011 6:27 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"5996"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"bubba-kush","user":"Anonymous","stars":"4","date":"4/8/2011 6:40 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Happy","Hungry"],"ID":"5997"},{"_type":"dict","content":"BOOM KUSH DAWG","strain":"purple-kush","user":"Anonymous","stars":"4.5","date":"4/8/2011 10:11 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Hungry","Sleepy"],"ID":"5998"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"super-lemon-haze","user":"sierrabeautiful","stars":"3.5","date":"4/8/2011 10:43 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Uplifted"],"ID":"5999"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Heavy euphoric body rush that persisted, and later, sleeping was delicious.\r\n","strain":"granddaddy-purple","user":"BlueNote","stars":"4","date":"4/8/2011 11:52 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy"],"ID":"6000"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Awesome taste: smooth.

I am a casual smoker, so usually it's the weekend and I am doing things around the house, yard work, etc. I also like this one when I am going to hang out at a bar with friends because it allows me to be \"present\" and social.  Some other strains tend to make me check out too much for that.\r\n\r\nI can also read some pretty heavy books while using Master Kush, which is nice since I am into all kinds of philosophical subjects. It's a good one for video games and movies since it doesn't tend to cause your mind to wander much like other strains do.\r\n\r\nMedicinally speaking, I suffer from some hereditary depression and anxiety which I have mostly controlled without the use of any drugs at all, thanks to educating myself about the problem.  However, there are some days where I wake up and I get some depressive effects and I become quiet, irritable and unmotivated.  A small hit of Kush tends to alleviate this for me, and put me in a much better mood.  Even once the effect of the weed wares off, I seem to have shaken off the depression I had felt prior.

Later when I was lucid again, I wondered if any of my neighbors saw me.  I'm sure they did.\r\n\r\nThis is a great one for Sundays when I like to study existential and philosophical subjects.  It tends to take me out of my head and straight into the stratosphere, which is nice in a meditative, exploratory sense. This is the kind of weed that will let you stop and stare in wonder at something that might normally seem insignificant, such as tree or smoke coming from an incense stick.\r\n\r\nI consider this strain, for my use, to be an antisocial weed if I am going to be around non-smokers who don't want to philosophize.

It has that old school style 70's stone that is very creative and also poseses a deep head trip type stone that will leave you well rested if you take it before you sleep. You will also get to finsh all of your artwork projects that you have partially started with this one. As for the plant itself, growing is very easy, just pot it with some really good soil and a good metal halide let it go and feed it a lot. You must trim out the inside and under the canopy extensivly if you are topping the plant. Topping with this strain I have found, twice is a great number and will produce a very fat crop. Topping is also advisable because this plant strain will max out your grow box if you let it veg for too long. If you plan to NOT top this plant then you will need to trim out bottoms of all lower branches and interior leaves and buds because this plant grows vertically for at least 3 weeks in the flowering stage of its life cycle and light penatration is minimal. Jack Herer will get tall if you veg enough under metal halide up to six to ten feet. You will get huge, very big single cola if not topped which are very impressive to have for show, although you will experience much bigger yeilds when the plant is topped and allowed to spread out a little. The best benifit that I get personally is that it controls my back pain which was negated and also my neck pain also. This is a very very good strain for pain relief and also good for the beginner growers but you ussually will have to pay a pretty penny, for the price of these seeds are commonly up in the top brackets.

Dopest dope I ever smoked.\" I am a die-hard indica enthusiast, and this 80% sativa hybrid took me on a wonderful journey and taught me that not all sativas have to feel like straight-up crack. Indica relieves my anxiety, wheras sativa typically exacerbates it-- though not with Super Dope!\r\n\r\nThe name \"Super Dope\" even holds true at a microscopic level: the trichromes don't have space between each other like they usually do on buds, they're bunched close together and look like they exploded in every direction. Talk about a sticky bomb!! The nugs are truly the DENSEST I have ever seen in my life; the dispensary owner joked that I'd need a razorblade to cut them because the grinder won't work.\r\n\r\nThe taste is unique: it has that familiar lemon flavor that you get from sativas, but it also has an overwhelming minty quality to it as well... it almost tastes like a toothpaste. The high is equally unique; as this flavor contains 24% THC, it definitely gives euphoria and an uplifting sensation that's mellow and not intense. Though I still can't understand how, it's surprisingly heavy for how alert the effects are. Excellent for depression!

It reminded me of rosemary or lavender.\r\n\r\nLooks: Dry, darker green with midtone orange hairs and a fine layer of crystals/trichomes. \r\n\r\nTaste: The taste wasn't overpowering and actually quite smooth/light. There was an aftertaste of weed, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing.\r\n\r\nMethod of Ingestion: Vapor Balloon, followed with a Joint.\r\n\r\nToker's Tolerance: Med-High. Daily Vapor-user.\r\n\r\nBuzz Type: A strong body high that relieved any muscle tension I had at the time. I was able to function at about 40% productivity (compared to a sober 80%), but found spelling and writing harder than normal. But, I was able to focus on reading and felt ambitious, it aided with an excellent high for researching/surfing the web.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour and a half later, I was suddenly sober. The comedown either didn't exist or was unnoticable as I ended up being, 'Hey. Where'd my high go?'. All of the pain relief that had come with the high, disappeared. It was fairly disappointing.\r\n\r\nSo, I rolled up and smoked a quick J. After this, the relief returned and the Kush effect kicked in. Life slowed down. I got tired. After working on some artwork, I ended up laying in bed and playing online games. I could have passed out if wanted, but didn't have to.\r\n\r\nBuzz Length: 1.5 - 2 hours top. \r\n\r\nOverall: I would classify the buzz as a hybrid with a strong, but very short body high. The sudden nature of the comedown was off-putting. The suggested donation price is too much for this strain. It is not worth 15$/gram, I would be more comfortable donating like 10$/gram as a fair price. The reason why the price is higher is due to the fact that it is a \"local favorite\".\r\n\r\nSuggested For: This is a good strain if you have somewhere to be in 4-5 hours and want to relax your muscles, do research or surf the web before you head out. If you smoke enough of it, it'd be good for a nap.\r\n\r\n*  When I was looking for pictures of this strain online, I found there has been discussion on whether this strain is truly an indica or just a hybrid-kush. This question comes with good reason, while there are kush-like qualities after smoking enough, the short timeline and the ability to be productive makes it questionable. There was no couchlock at all. I even went to the market down the street because I wanted some orange soda. Now, if I was smoking a pure, heavy indica, I'd be drinking water and pretending it was orange soda because I'm too relaxed to get dressed and go out in the rain for a soda. I was told it was Indica.\r\n\r\nhttp://stonedinseattle.blogspot.com/","strain":"violator-kush","user":"PrincessTHC","stars":"3","date":"5/10/2011 5:37 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Focused","Sleepy"],"ID":"7467"},{"_type":"dict","content":"shishkkabeery is xreate good taste great high\r\n","strain":"shishkaberry","user":"plebion","stars":"0","date":"5/10/2011 5:53 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke"],"ID":"7468"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"romulan","user":"PrincessTHC","stars":"4","date":"5/10/2011 5:54 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Giggly","Hungry"],"ID":"7469"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"bubba-kush","user":"el.jefe","stars":"4.5","date":"5/10/2011 8:20 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy","Hungry","Sleepy","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"7470"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-widow","user":"Anonymous","stars":"5","date":"5/10/2011 8:51 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Uplifted","Happy","Tingly","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"7471"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blue-widow","user":"wekwe1sr","stars":"5","date":"5/10/2011 8:53 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Uplifted","Happy","Tingly","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"7472"},{"_type":"dict","content":"The come down is very relaxing and it seems to last forever!","strain":"mk-ultra","user":"MishMisch","stars":"4.5","date":"5/10/2011 10:30 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy","Tingly","Dizzy","Dry Eyes","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"7473"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I am a very anxious person, and often marijuana exacerbates that tendency.

Definitely makes me feel stupid quickly, but also euphoric and easygoing, so I am totally comfortable even around family members while high on Jack Herer. The awesome boost in creativity makes up for the reduction in logic-based brainpower, so I actually feel just as quick-witted, and functional as I do sober, (which admittedly isn't saying much). As a classic sativa, I've found that the best thing to do while high on jack is to walk around outside, or just sit and think. It is not the best weed for enjoying mindless things, like watching TV. In fact, if I smoke this weed and then neglect to explore my imagination, I usually get antsy, and even anxious. Jack Herer may not have completely lived up to my expectations because of the relatively short time that the primary buzz lasts. The first time I got a quarter of this stuff was right after buying some great Sour D from the same dealer, and I was hoping for the same sort of thing. While the creative boost is similar to that of sour, I felt that diesel was more powerful, and long lasting. If i want to get super blazed, and really let go for the day, I'd smoke Sour Diesel, whereas Jack Herer is easy to use multiple times in a day and still manage my responsibilities.

I think it is in my common nature, like a born with it kind of reason. I toked up awhile ago so it might be wearing off so next time I'll smoke then immediately change my responses accordingly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIuno I feel like it is gonna take awhile to get over \"this\". I hope it comes fast and soon. I felt I was doing fine, I guess because of my new friends but now that they aren't here whom am I supposed to turn to? The people up here also to have someone, again leaving me \"single'ed\" out. a constant reminder, a constant bothersome. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsidenote: I'm going to use this as my actual blog. I always find tumblr as a great outlet for things I can't say when in actuality most of the time I don't actually blog and am afraid of what I post. But this journal will be extraordinary. It is where my mind is actually free. My thoughts are literally allowed to wander to all sorts of dimensions? lol. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nback to what I was getting at. I think my music is playing too loud @ 3:07AM.. This is my first time getting high alone with vanilla kush and it is a good one! I'm satisfied. But gah I wish this night was over with. I just want to see everything that has happened. I'm scared of what to find, but I can't wait to? I don't think I'll ever be satisfied with life, Never. I secretly admire the women who are entirely independent. I long to be that type of girl. My mind moves at a rate of 239479237832 miles per hour. Nowadays it is so hard to find those kind of girls who are happy with themselves. I feel stuck, like I don't want to be back to where I was at but also I can't seem to move on forward and let the past stay in the past. just earlier I was thinking, wow famous people have it good in life. But now I'm thinking that, for me, it wouldn't be. I wouldnt want to constantly be watched. My every move documented. My whole life people who keep tabs on me for them to witness, when in fact I may never know who they are. That's scary. You have a lot of liability at stake for you are influencing others. But to think again, who wouldn't want the luxury to travel? to not worry about money? to know you have the world at the palm of your hands? where fortunes come to easily. where in a sense you could wish for it and have it so easily handed to you? I think as of late, I've always had something to worry about, when will I be free? Problems keep coming in life. I make things so hard for myself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a feeling I'm going to look back at this time where I'm at now, at the age of 19, and think how sillly was I to be so hung over that boy.

I thought id post some notes on the strains primary effects in particular. A regular occurring effect with this strain i found was a strong sense of satisfaction and happiness, it didn't seem to matter greatly where i was just that everything seemed blissful.  A side effect of this i noticed was that i was soo content in myself, that everything i was looking at visually  gained a greater sense of importance and focus. Consequently whilst smoking i would glance at something briefly and end up glaring at it for a long duration. This is not to be confused with a heightened sense of focus because the further attention to visuals seemed shallow in thought and i wouldn't particularly generate any thoughts in regards to what i was looking at. I didn't experience any strong negative effects from smoking Black Widow other than a slight irritation whilst trying to get comfortable and a urge to prepare large snacks to munch on. I would recommend laid back comfortable activities such a listening to music, sitting by a camp-fire etc. just anything where you can sit comfortable to avoid irritation and also something visually stimulating.","strain":"black-widow","user":"grassynole","stars":"3.5","date":"6/1/2011 2:14 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Giggly","Hungry","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"8378"},{"_type":"dict","content":"so many hairs, i thought i was looking at chewbaccas balls","strain":"orange-kush","user":"Byronwithatush","stars":"4.5","date":"6/1/2011 3:50 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Uplifted","Happy","Talkative"],"ID":"8379"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"purple-trainwreck","user":"Anonymous","stars":"4","date":"6/1/2011 3:51 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Uplifted","Energetic","Happy","Paranoid","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"8380"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"super-silver-haze","user":"Anonymous","stars":"3.5","date":"6/1/2011 3:55 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Uplifted","Energetic"],"ID":"8381"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Heavy hitter, good indica.

Its scent reminds me of sappy wood.

Not as much of a happy/euphoric high as I like but my friend seemed to get a really happy high from it so I'll be trying it again.","strain":"la-confidential","user":"akralston","stars":"4","date":"6/3/2011 3:08 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Energetic","Talkative","Giggly","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"8447"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"5dc2c210-be0e-4943-9ab8-37a6848b8258","user":"akralston","stars":"3.5","date":"6/3/2011 3:11 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Uplifted","Giggly","Tingly","Sleepy"],"ID":"8448"},{"_type":"dict","content":"need to try this one again when I'm less high - kinda hard to tell much about it from this time","strain":"bb459640-c4bd-46c2-bc59-358f52b7c27a","user":"akralston","stars":"3.5","date":"6/3/2011 3:14 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy","Sleepy","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"8449"},{"_type":"dict","content":"need to try this one again when I'm less high - kinda hard to tell much about it from this time","strain":"bb459640-c4bd-46c2-bc59-358f52b7c27a","user":"akralston","stars":"3.5","date":"6/3/2011 3:15 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Happy","Sleepy","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"8450"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"p-51","user":"Anonymous","stars":"4","date":"6/3/2011 3:47 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Talkative","Giggly","Hungry","Aroused"],"ID":"8451"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"red-dragon","user":"someguy2448","stars":"4.5","date":"6/3/2011 5:23 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Talkative","Sleepy","Dizzy"],"ID":"8452"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"blueberry","user":"someguy2448","stars":"3.5","date":"6/3/2011 5:25 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Focused","Hungry","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"8453"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"northern-lights","user":"someguy2448","stars":"4","date":"6/3/2011 5:28 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Uplifted","Happy","Talkative","Hungry","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"8454"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"sour-kush","user":"someguy2448","stars":"3.5","date":"6/3/2011 5:31 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Uplifted","Happy","Hungry","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"8455"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"power-plant","user":"someguy2448","stars":"3","date":"6/3/2011 5:32 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Happy","Talkative","Tingly","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"8456"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"m-39","user":"someguy2448","stars":"3","date":"6/3/2011 5:33 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Uplifted","Focused","Happy","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"8457"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"100-og","user":"Anonymous","stars":"0","date":"6/3/2011 6:00 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative"],"ID":"8458"},{"_type":"dict","content":"..::One Hit Wonder::..","strain":"alaskan-thunder-fuck","user":"Anonymous","stars":"4","date":"6/3/2011 6:18 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Uplifted","Energetic","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"8459"},{"_type":"dict","content":"I smoked this with my friends in his hottub, and wow, couldnt stop cracking up!

We went down by trestles and turned left under three freeway cause we thought there was a pine forest there. Then Colby found a path that went nude the freeway pillar and found a perfect spot to smoke. When Brennan took the first hit, we heard sounds (voices) from the bigger road, and we freaked out. Jake investigated and found out it was three stoners from JSerra (Keefa's friends). We then commenced to smoking a half bowl (hitmaster) of it. As we walked back up home, we began to feel some effects. Colby said he was \"on jupiter\" then we talked about random stuff and started laughing. When we got home we put on the hitmaster playlist, which was soon replaced by dubstep. We danced the robot and many variations of the hip-thrust. After this we moved on to a minecraft brainstorm for pagan craft. We came up with epic ideas for the mods. 8:00 PM… coffee, cup of noodles… 11:55 PM everyone's in bed. time to smoke again. pack another hitmaster and get super baked. literally bed locked half awake head on the side table watching a bear getting castrated. almost like being out for an hour in a surreal state of sleep/euphoric/chill. 1:45 Jake is in a bath robe… \"Lets write the review\". (Laziness had worn off, then wrote this). Then we thought it was over.. Second wave hit us, three-four hour time lapse, looked at the clock and it was 4:45. Thought only an hour had gone by. Craazzy.

However this strain is nothing like the SSH. This is a stoney, hit you right between the eyes type of smoke. The flush is very good/perfect about 80% of the time (there has been maybe 3 times out of the MANY purchases of this strain that the flush was less then perfect, but still better then many flowers I have come across), burning to a very light gray ash.  The very first hit is by far my favorite, especially when I smoke this out of my Roor or in a Joint, those are by far the two methods of consumption that I feel make this strain shine. Anyways, back to what that first hit is like, it's goes straight to your dome, with thick chemy smoke that fills your lungs, and a high that rushes straight to your eyes. Coughing almost always occurs. The high continues to build into a very strong \"stone\" amazing body relaxation, and any daily aches and pains are memories at the moment. The intense head high is shorter lived and peaks around 40 mins, the body high and general sense of relaxation lasts much longer, generally close to 2 hours. As always the cure is the only place this bud is lacking, and keeping it from getting an 10/10, the buds are always dried, so it's not like your getting wet bud, but simply drying your flower properly is not the same as proper CURING, but as that is the only complaint I can come up with when thinking of my dear OG Chem Dawg it's hard to be too upset.

Perhaps it was because I only took one hit (I like to do a review for each time I smoke, increasing the hits by 1 every time) but I was less than thrilled. The high was not bad by any means, but it was just not what I had expected from something so famous. It also may have been the drying of the buds and the degradation of THC. Unfortunately, thats what you have t deal with when you can't get it medically. Taking peoples words that it is the strain they say and that whomever grew it grew, dried, cured and stored it properly. Overall I'm not going to call it yet, I'll have to smoke it a few more times before I can get an official opinion. A nice body high and it let me sleep like a baby when I wanted to.

What's so genuine about Hindu Kush, the finest Kush of them all in my humble opinion, is how high I get after a few hits.  I stay stoned off the same bone all day lighting it 5, six times throughout the day.  It has a uplifting daytime effect, yet a mellow, whimsical evening effect and at bedtime \"say goodnight Trixie\"      ","strain":"hindu-kush","user":"Randy","stars":"4.5","date":"6/10/2011 4:39 AM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Uplifted","Happy","Talkative","Aroused","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"8777"},{"_type":"dict","content":"This is an awesome strain.

When you cross two different IBL strains for the first time, it is called the F1 generation. When you cross two of the same F1 hybrid (inbreed), it is called the F2 generation. The process of selective inbreeding must continue at least until the F4 to stabilize the recurrently selected traits. When you cross two specimens of an IBL variety, you get more of the same, because an IBL is homozygous, or true breeding for particular traits.\r\n\r\nPure OG generally creates a body high that is relaxing and medicinal. Pure OG has higher CBD than THC equals a much heavier, sleepy type of high, that is good for a variety of medical problems.

HerbalMatch.org is the S***! Ryan is an awesome person to have a chat with, while remaining professional and discrete at all times. This was my first meeting with Ryan @ HerbalMatch.org, so I wanted to write a complete and accurate review so I apologize for the length.\r\n\r\nI had spoke with Ryan a few time before coming to my house and he was a complete professional throughout the whole entire process. I was still a little cautious and weary about the whole delivery service as any responsible patient should be. So to ease my anxiety I had smoked a little bit before to calm my stress. I was feeling a little awkward due to being medicated, but Ryan was SUPER NICE / FUNNY and made me feel at ease. I'm sure he could tell that I was medicated, but he treated me with such class that I had totally relaxed. So far I was loving this guy! The best part is that he came to my house ABSOLUTELY FOR FREE!! With the price of gas soaring, I thought that was pretty cool. \r\n\r\nSince there were not any pictures I was a little hesitant to setup a meeting to purchase a half ounce. Ryan expressed his acknowledgement for my concerns. When he arrived we chatted while he let me sample each and EVERY strain that he carries in the comfort of my own living room!!!!! It was like going to Baskin Robbins!! It was THE BEST THING EVER!! I believe that all dispensaries/collectives should allow you to sample anything before you make a purchase! I ended up going the the KEN'S GDP which was dense, frosty, and very potent. I would give the bud a rating of 9/10 for taste 9/10 for appearance 9/10 price. My man Ryan is an innovator and a person who cares about his patients. I would like to consider myself a cannabis connoisseur and someone who is knowledgeable in many aspects of the cannabis community. With that said I was pleasantly surprised when Ryan was able to show me a battery operated portable vaporizer that I had never ever seen before. If you love cannabis and want to be WOW'd then HerbalMatch.org is definitely the place for you. I'm happy to say it is my new place when I want a hassle free transaction with no lines/crowds.\r\n\r\nHowever, he did not only meet me for free, he also gave me a free pre-roll (valued @ $10) which I first wasn't overfilled with joy about because I have already been through the whole pre-roll gimmick with tons of dispensaries in the past. The 5 for $20 deal or 2 for $10 etc. the list goes on and on... Most of the time they are filled with s***y weed or shake. So you can now understand my reasoning for being a little hesitant of the pre-roll campaign. When I saw the pre-roll's it gave me more hope because they were pre-packaged from a vendor (Americone). I have smoked pre-roll's from vendors like this before, but for twice the money and they were definitely not worth the money, but I had NEVER tried this company before so what could I lose at least it was FREE right?! Because I had previously spoken with Ryan many times before our visit, he knew that I was a HUGE indica fan. So he had brought at least 15-20 different strains in pre-roll's for me to choose from. I ended up picking the Blackberry Kush which sounded delicious. When I decided to smoke my first Americone pre-roll I ripped the sealed package open and first took a whiff. I was kinda disappointed to be honest. The smell was definitely not what I had imagined, but I decided to give it a shot anyway. I was EXTREMELY surprised!! It was the smoothest pre-roll I had ever smoked. It burned like a cigarette without any runs and even had a pleasant minty taste to it. To make it even better it was definitely strong and potent. I was satisfied. I have paid for pre-roll of this quality for $20 each and these are only $10 TAX INCLUDED & DELIVERED!! Sign me up cause I will be back every week FOR SURE!","strain":"granddaddy-purple","user":"smoke1408","stars":"4.5","date":"6/16/2011 7:06 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Hungry","Sleepy","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"9044"},{"_type":"dict","content":"","strain":"shishkaberry","user":"biggdogue","stars":"4.5","date":"6/16/2011 7:47 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Euphoric","Uplifted","Sleepy","Dry Mouth"],"ID":"9045"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Very smooth taste with a lingering sweetness through out the entire bowl.

I don't really remember who I was with.\r\n\r\nThen I smoked a little of everything with Robby, Rachel, and some other people.  A little Purple Mountain, Blue Dream, and Korkle  After that we went to Yesterdog and I got the standard.  Oh and Rachel sat next to me :3\r\n\r\nVery glad I stayed the night.  There's a bunch I'm forgetting but I can add it all later.

This is the stuff he bought from Julian, he called it exotic something.\r\n\r\nAfter Frisbee golfing with Robby and Eric, we went back to Robby's where Natalie and Christian were hanging out (which was awkward).  Eric left, then Robby and I smoked.  I called Tom and laughed at him for probably 2 straight minutes before he hung up.  Then we went and watched Black Swan, Robby went to sleep halfway through and Natalie and Christian watched the rest with me.  Then they both went to bed and Aaron came home, I talked with him and played NHL with him before he went to bed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nJuly 6th (adding here because strain is not available).  Smoked a bowl with Robby at his place.  Eric drank and Jon would've if he didn't hate the Scotch.\r\n\r\nBeforehand, Eric (and later Robby) walked around in the nasty-ass pond and found a few good discs.  During that time, Jon and I walked back to do a few holes.  It was a bit odd, but we had some good conversation.  The first hole, I threw my disc right into a tree.  After about 20 minutes (and some extra help) we got it out and did a few more holes before Eric (and later) Robby came back.  When we got home, we hung out with the drunk neighbors a bit.  \r\n\r\nRobby and I smoked a bowl, while Eric sat in the corner and started drinking.  After about 10 minutes we walked back downstairs and fucked around (I forget the order of events).  We called John and Bryan a few times.  Then Eric called Scott and Matt \"pretending\" to be Triboner.  Later, Drew came inside and smoked a little more with us.  He's a bit strange, but pretty cool.  After everyone went upstairs, Eric randomly flopped over and vomited.  He bent forward and started wiping it up with the towel and also rubbing it into his face.  He threw up again about 10 minutes later, so I got him another towel.  He rubbed them into the floor (along with his blanket) and rubbed his face into them.  When he finished \"cleaning\", he pushed the couch over and put his dirty blanket on the floor and fell asleep.

A Master grower in Bellingham WA. brought the seeds over to the US and grew all 10 of them.  Word has it that these were some \"special\" behind the counter seeds that were offered to make up for a previous bad purchase several months before that wasted the growers time. Out of the 10 seeds that were labeled, the #5 plant was cloned (why you see it labeled DT #5) and sent out to the local growers in Bellingham that passed it around to \"close\" friends.  Today it is all over the West Coast including Maui and seems to be growing in popularity due to its heavy yields, easy trimming and rapid growth.  Because it is a relatively new strain (4 Years), clubs that have acquired this strain for sale can't seem to keep it in stock as customers often go on a waiting list to get it.   \r\n\r\nThere is some confusion as to it's name since there are other older versions of \"Dutch Treat\" that don't look anything like the #5, nor compare in quality.  For this reason, some people have called it Dutch Crunch instead.  \r\n\r\nAs to it's crosses, you would have to contact Jordan of the Islands to really get the detailed truth. Seed companies that sell the seeds still classify it as a \"short and stalky\" plant, but as any experienced grower would tell you, this plant is WAY OUT OF CONTROL, viney, lanky, extremely fast growing and sometimes falls over even before it starts budding.  Anyone trying to grow this plant, be ready to tie her down hard and use supports.   Many classify Dutch Treat as a heavy Indica punch you in the face High, yet the leaves on the plant are very much Sativa, very skinny, and harvesting goes to at least 8-9 weeks, sometimes more. \r\n\r\n","strain":"dutch-treat","user":"gatherlight","stars":"5","date":"6/22/2011 12:13 PM","attributes":["Flower ","Smoke","Creative","Euphoric","Giggly","Tingly"],"ID":"9275"},{"_type":"dict","content":"Nice batch again.

(stardust is my term for the multi-colored glow that appears around bright things in the dark, usually screens cause it looks like distorted rainbow glittery stuff that shimmers... stardust. woot!) this is pretty typical if im high enough. it was similar to Demerol and vicoden with a crazy thc high thrown in. i started to get hungry about 30 minutes later, so like traditionally do when im gonna make something i take another hit... this one was just as big as the last. wow, ok this is where it get trippy... my head was totally tripping out, similar to LSD (lysergic acid, not the marijuana strain) in the way that your mind works and thinks. you cannot control your thoughts, you just have to ride them out and enjoy it. im not saying i was hallucinating like LSD, cause i wasnt, im saying my thoughts were similar to that while under the influence of LSD. (im eating at this point btw)... soon thereafter it was as if i was an observer looking in at my thoughts. past dreams and experiences from long long ago were resurfacing and i was feeling them and watching them (with my minds eye) unfold before me. they only lasted about 1 minute, but felt like i had been living in each one of those thoughts for an hour or so. i went through about 10-15 'psycho-visions' until i eventually put on some solar fields (movements) and zoned out. it was one of the most intense psychological experiences i have ever had. i just find it really bizzare cause ive never had that happen to me while smoking marijuana alone. needless to say, it was friggin awesome! was definitely a positive self explorational experience. \r\n\r\nbut like how i started this review, i posted the other strains that i smoked before i hit this, so i cannot say that it was just the lemon kush, but i smoked about the double the lemon kush than the other two combined. i smoked A LOT of the lemon kush at once, but as we all know mixing strains can produce drastically different results, but hey, it doesnt hurt to experiment. \r\n\r\nhappy smokin!

The high was slow to come on at first and to be quite honest after exhaling the first two hits I was disappointing at the lack of intensity I get from the things I normally smoke, like OG Kush, OG Chem Dawg, or SSH, all those strains are ones that after the first few hits you can feel their high rapidly accelerating. For some reason I didn't feel myself paying too close of attention to the taste, so it undoubtedly must not have been unpleasant, perhaps trying this through a bong would bring out tastes hidden by my slightly dirty pipe. I did find myself making some smoke rings, so the smoke was definitely thick in nature leading me to believe that this was soil grown, always a plus in my book.  The bowl ends and I feel a definite high, but nothing too pronounced, just a heightened sense of the things around me, like sounds and colors. I wander to the kitchen and snag a bag of chips and go back to listening to music and cruising the internet. This is where this strain's beauty lies. 10 minutes go by my bag of chips is over half gone, but I am still hungry, hmm for what, sweet stuff! I grab an orange. Devoured. Back to my chips. Chips gone. Yeah, this herb gives the strongest munchies I have had in a LONG time. Like old school Blueberry Blunts would always have me at the 7-11 buying a giant slurpee and 2 for $3 taquitos, this herb takes me back to those days :). I highly recommend this strain to anyone with appetite issues especially due to chemo or HIV/AIDS, as this high is very uplifting. Querkle is said to be an indica dominate strain so I'm intrigued as to it's effects on pain, but it didn't couch lock me so that's awesome. I'm a fan of this herb, but I'm not too sure how often I can smoke it as I already love eating more then I should ;) haha.

The smell is overwhelming but yet you wish your whole house smelled this good! The bright greens and orange wrapped in crystals seem to glow under the right light illuminating this majestic medication. Not a very harsh hitter, \"goes down smooth when I get a clean hit\" but it's the after taste that seem's to just make me want more, very tasty, almost fruit like. The high is a very nice uplifting affect followed by a bit of creativity, maybe a small \"duh\" factor, watching a good T.V. show with this medication is great. Not the longest lasting but it definitley packs a punch. a great medication for a quick, happy, energetic head change especially if you like 'em stinky and tasty!

I had heard good things about it, so I figured I'd try it. When I got there, Mike took me back and showed me all the (VERY BEAUTIFUL) strains. I told him what I wanted, and he told me that Black Widow was LAST week's special, and that the current special was Super Skunk. However, luckily, they were out of Super Skunk, so he gave me the Widow at the discounted price! (Thanks for that!). Let me just say, I wish I had taken pictures when I first got it. It was the blackest, most crystalline bud I have EVER seen, and they give you big cuttings, not little dried up buds. I've been making the widow last, usually mixing it with other strains, for good reason. ANYTIME I smoke Black Widow, I'm guaranteed to be happy, carefree, and pain-free for the next few hours.

I split a fat nug with my friend and I was confused at first, because I had heard that Green Crack was so dank but I wasn't getting it. So I got through my bowl kind of unimpressed. THEN, my face around my eyes started to tingle and my face muscles felt lazy, my eyelids drooped, and I reached for my friend's bong again. The last thing I remember is saying 'just one more hit!'. I thought I passed out for 45 minutes, but when I looked at my phone only 2 had passed. I woke up panicked because I thought I might have done something I can't remember, or gotten myself in trouble, or wandered somewhere. I had that disoriented panic that lasted maybe 5 seconds, but that was 4 minutes to me. I didn't control my body too well, and the weight of my limbs and molasses in my brain and sense of loopy detachment convinced me I was in a lucid dream. I called my friend to comfort myself. She thought I was absolutely insane, because I was saying 'I was thiiiiiiinking, hehehehehe....okay, I was thinkingggggg that hehehehhHahahahahahaha okay, maybe I'm in a dreeeaam right now and I'm not annooooooying you with my pot talk in hehehehehehhe in REAL LIFE.' \r\nIt was hard to understand my legs...it felt like I was on wheels that lagged behind my brain instructions. It was like being a baby. I had to relearn walking. We smoked on top of a hill...getting down without breaking my face was easy. I just told my brain 'get me down without hurting me.' and he did that. I recognized that I didn't know anything right then so I had to trust my brain to do what needed to be done. If I wanted to go faster, I told my brain 'speed up!' and the connection would be made in my leg wheels to turn faster. Then, I discovered my knees. I was overwhelmed with joy. I FOUND MY KNEES. I GOT IT GUYS. I HAVE FUCKING KNEES. THAT'S HOW THIS SHIT WORKS!!!\r\nI was just consumed with my knees and their discovery. KNEES. Those are the spokes in my leg wheels!!\r\nI was able to walk down a street, but I was giggly and it was obvious I was stoned out of my tree. I knew not to jump in front of cars but f there was someone speeding or running a red light I don't know if I would have been able to utilize my sense of self-preservation. Which seems depressing in retrospect. \r\nI didn't have the munchies. I was just concerned that my high would last the rest of my life. I truly believed it would. I thought my lucid dream lalaland where I zoomed around on thigh wheels was forEVER. Time was torturously slow. \r\nI went to Pete's coffee. I had to dig out my money. My backpack was an infinite black pit. SHIT. I really wanted to look sober. I forgot the price of my tea four times. The coffee guy had to hold up\r\nHis fingers to mime the numbers before I understood him. \r\nI bought tickets for Green Lantern 3D, but if I had seen that I would have died. Bridesmaids is terrible. It is a really awful movie. You'd think stoned....no. Worse. The blond woman actress looks like the monster Grim Reaper of nightmare death. And then it's just stupid, all I remember is some 50 year old asshole grabbed the Gr Reaper's 50 year old tit and started rolling it around and time was folded like 20 times into itself and it was just so much longer and revolting than necessary. \r\nBy now, I know life isn't a dream. No munchies. I had to force myself to eat an apple to bring me down a bit so that I could function.\r\nI blacked out a lot...which was weird and unanticipated. My conversation was slow and disjointed. I tried to talk fast to compensate because I knew I was high. Didn't work. Time didn't work. Two minutes felt like 20. \r\nI wasn't euphoric or in bliss. Just vaguely relaxed and detached. I took a break from myself. I thought I didn't like Green Crack. Looking back...I'm nuts for that shit. Can't wait till I can get my fingers on more. \r\nNOT FOR BEGINNERS OR LIGHTWEIGHTS OR ME PROBABLY but fuck that. I snickered for 15 minutes that my movie was at 4.20.\r\nI know this is long, but I like the stories. Sorry guys.
